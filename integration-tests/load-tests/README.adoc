= Hawkular Metrics Load Tests
:type: article

A simple load testing tool for Hawkular Metrics

== Why a Maven project?

Because it makes it easier for developers to fire a load test:
there's no need to download, extract and configure PATH.

== The scenario

The simulation consists in sending metrics reports from a configurable number of clients (like a collector sending
reports periodically). On top of the number of clients, many aspects of the simulation are configurable:
number of loops, interval, number of metrics per report, ... etc.

== Running

 mvn gatling:execute -Dxxx=y ...

Each scenario option can be set with a system property.

The scenario assumes a Metrics server is running somewhere and does not start one.

|Description

|baseURI
|Base location of the Hawkular Metrics service. Defaults to `\http://localhost:8080/hawkular/metrics`

|authType
|Authentication type. Possible values include `openshiftHtpasswd`, `openshiftToken` and `hawkular`.
Authentication is disabled when unset.

|user
|Authentication username. Must be set when `authType` is set to `openshiftHtpasswd` or `hawkular`.

|password

|token
|Authentication token. Must be set when `authType` is set to `openshiftToken`.

|tenant
|Defaults to `default`. Ignored if `authType` is `hawkular`.

|clients
|Number of concurrent clients (agent/collector/feed). Defaults to `10`.

|ramp
|Delay (in seconds) before firing up another client. Defaults to `1`.

|loops
|The number of loops for each simulated client. Defaults to `10`.

|interval
|Interval (in seconds) between metrics reports. Defaults to `1`.

|metrics
|Number of metrics in the JSON report. Defaults to `10`.

|points
|Number of data points for a metric. Defaults to `1`.

|duration
|The number of minutes that the test should run. By default the test does not use this and executes
 `loops` for each client. If this option is specified (with a non-zero value) as well as `loops`, the
