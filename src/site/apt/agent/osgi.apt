OSGi Agent

 For using an agent within an OSGi container, Jolokia comes with
 agents packaged OSGi bundles. They come in two flavours:

 * The standard bundle which requires an OSGi HttpService
   as specified by the OSGi group. Prominent implementations of this
   service are {{{http://wiki.ops4j.org/display/paxweb/Pax+Web}Pax Web}} and
   {{{http://felix.apache.org/site/apache-felix-http-service.html}Apache
   Felix HttpService}}. This bundle fits best the OSGi philosophy of
   modularity and is hence the recommended bundle.

 * A all-in-one bundle with no external dependencies except to the
   <<<org.osgi.service.log.LogService>>> OSGi bundle. It includes the
   Apache Felix HttpService which in turn includes a Jetty server. T
   embedded Jetty server and is suitable for situations where ease of
   deployment is more important than modularity.

  Note, that some OSGi container (like Eclipse Virgo) comes with a so
  called <Web extender> which allows for deployment of standard
  Webarchives (war). For such container, there is a choice between the
  OSGi bundle and the WAR agent, where the later is probably easier to
  deploy since there is already an HTTP server running in such
  containers, which not necessarily export an OSGi HTTP service
  required by the standard bundle.

  More details about the OSGi agents can be found in the
  {{{../reference/html/agents.html#agents-osgi}Jolokia reference manual}}.
