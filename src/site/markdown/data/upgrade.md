Database Upgrades
=================
If using an external database server, such as MySQL, a DBA must manually perform
the database upgrades. Currently, a copy of the initialization and upgrade scripts
for MySQL can be found in the [github repository](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/tree/master/dependency-check-core/src/main/resources/data).

If you want to use an external database other then MySQL please open an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues)
as a dialect properties file will need to be created.
