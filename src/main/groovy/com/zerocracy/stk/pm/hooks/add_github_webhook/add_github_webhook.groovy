// @todo #1048:30min Implement logic for adding webhook in add_github_webhook
//  stakeholder (see #1048 for details). After it is implemented uncomment
//  adds_github_webhook test and make sure it passes. In production we need to
//  use url: http://www.rehttp.net/p/https://www.0crat.com/ghook, and in testing
//  we use  current url of our instance + "/ghook".
//  Add another test that will check that in case
//  we don't have enough permissions we will inform the user about it.
