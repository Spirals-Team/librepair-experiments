 * @todo #1105:30min Title element, of an order in agenda, has been declared in
 *  agenda.xsd. The stakeholder set_agenda_title_from_github.groovy must be
 *  implemented correctly: it just runs an script that returns the
 *  same value. It must get the title value from github issue and set agenda
 *  title with this value. The tests were already implemented in #1105
 *  resolution.
