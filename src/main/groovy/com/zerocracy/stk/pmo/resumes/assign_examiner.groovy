 * Assign examiner to resume. When new resume submitted and added to

 * @todo #1352:30min New users can also be invited by PMO
 *  members (has any role in PMO project) or QAs in Zerocracy (C3NDPUA8L)
 *  project without resumes check.
 *  On invite we should notify user and examiner and add +32 reputation
 *  points to examiner. Also examiner should be able to reject resume by
 *  saying `deny @username`.
 * @todo #1146:30min Test for this stakeholder is missed. We should verify
 *  that new resume can be assigned only to high-reputation user (>= 1024)
