    <a href="http://www.xmlunit.org/">XMLUnit</a> helps testing code
    that creates XML.

    <p>XMLUnit for Java is separated into two jars:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>xmlunit-core</code> contains all algorithms and
        classes needed to validate XML, perform XPath queries or
        compare two pieces of XML.</li>
      <li><code>xmlunit-matchers</code>
        contains <a href="http://hamcrest.org/JavaHamcrest/">Hamcrest</a>
        matchers on top of <code>xmlunit-core</code>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>While XMLUnit is focussed on testing, parts of it may be useful
      in different contexts as well.  The {@link
      org.xmlunit.diff.DifferenceEngine} may be the driver behind a
      visual XML diff tool for example.</p>

    <p>The main use case of XMLUnit is comparing XML generated by the
      code under test with some known source of "good XML".  This is
      the responsibility of the {@link
      org.xmlunit.diff.DifferenceEngine} and its main (currently sole)
      implementation {@link org.xmlunit.diff.DOMDifferenceEngine}.</p>

    <p>Sometimes a full comparison is more than is needed in which
      case only parts of the generated document are validated using
      XPaths.  This is the responsibility of {@link
      org.xmlunit.xpath.XPathEngine} and its implementation {@link
      org.xmlunit.xpath.JAXPXPathEngine}.</p>

    <p>The <a href="org/xmlunit/validation/package-summary.html">validation</a>
      package contains everything needed to validate documents against
      XML Schema (or even the schema document itself) or a DTD.  Based
      of JAXP's validation package the {@link
      org.xmlunit.validation.JAXPValidator} class should be able to
      validate against different schema languages as well if you
      provided it with the needed implementations.</p>

    <p>The <a href="org/xmlunit/builder/package-summary.html">builder</a>
      package contains fluent builders that may provide an API that is
      more convenient to use in many cases.</p>

    <p>A third jar <code>xmlunit-legacy</code> provides an API
      compatible to XMLUnit for Java 1.x that is implemented on top of
      XMLUnit Core.</p>
