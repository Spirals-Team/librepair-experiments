<div>

    Enter a list of jobs that metrics should be collected for. 
    If Use Regex is unchecked (default), the list of jobs is comma separated. E.g.:
    <pre>susans-job,johns-job,prod_folder/prod_release</pre>

    If Use Regex is checked, the list of jobs is separated by newlines and can include tags. E.g.:
    <pre>
            susans-job, optional:tag1
            (*?)-job, owner:$1
            (*?)_folder/(*?)_release, folder_env:$1, release_env:$2, optional:tag3
    </pre>

</div>
