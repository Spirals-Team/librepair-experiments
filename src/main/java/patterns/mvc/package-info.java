/**
 * Package provides an example of the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern.
 * <p>
 * MVC Components
 * The model is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the
 * user interface.[6] It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the
 * application.
 * A view can be any output representation of information, such as a chart or a
 * diagram. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar
 * chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.
 * The third part or section, the controller, accepts input and converts it to
 * commands for the model or view.[ *
