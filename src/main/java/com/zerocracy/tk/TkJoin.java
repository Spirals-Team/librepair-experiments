/**
 * Join Zerocracy form.
 *
 * @author Yegor Bugayenko (yegor256@gmail.com)
 * @author Kirill (g4s8.public@gmail.com)
 * @version $Id$
 * @since 0.20
 * @todo #653:30min We should allow user to send `/join` requests only once
 *  a week, it can be checked and updated via People.applied methods.
 *  The 7 days value can be accessed via Par after
 *  https://github.com/zerocracy/zerocracy.github.io/issues/9 fix.
 * @todo #800:30min Requests to /join should add an entry to 'resumes.xml'
 *  then an 'examiner' should be assigned. When the examiner "invites" a user,
 *  we check whether there was a resume for that user.
 *  If yes, we pay examiner +32 points. Examiner can reject a resume
 *  by saying 'deny {username}' (where username is a login in 'resumes.xml')
 *  to Zerocrat. In that case we also pay +32 to the examiner.
 *  Each user should see the status of his/her resume at /join.
 *  If the resume is there, he/she should see the resume, not the form.
 *  If he/she already has a mentor, there should be a redirect,
 *  saying that "User @yegor256 is already your mentor, no need to join again".
 *  See https://github.com/zerocracy/farm/issues/800#issuecomment-375551970
 *  comment for details.
