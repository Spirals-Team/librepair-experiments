/**
 * <p>
 * Convenience class for listening for updates to a particular player ship,
 * indicated by ship index. The ship index is usually omitted from updates,
 * but the first update will always specify it. This class automates the
 * tactic of noting the ID of the ship with the given index, and using that to
 * identify the ship from then on. When an update for the specific ship is
 * received, the onShipUpdate() method is invoked.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * To use, extend the class and implement onShipUpdate(), then pass an instance
 * of your subclass into ArtemisNetworkInterface.addListener().
