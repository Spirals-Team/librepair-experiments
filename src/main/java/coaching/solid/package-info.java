/**
 * Package provides examples of the SOLID principles
 * <p>
 * Detailed description of package.
 *
 * The five SOLID principles of object-oriented programming. - Single
 * Responsibility principle. A class should have the responsibility for a single
 * requirement, it should be possible to describe the class with a single word
 * or short phrase. It should have a single reason to change. - Open Closed
 * principle. A class should be open for extension, but closed to modification.
 * - Liskov Substitution principle. A class should replaceable with instances of
 * its specialisation without altering the correctness of that program. -
 * Interface Segregation principle. A class should separate it interface from
 * its implementation. Interfaces should be fine grained to specific interfaces
 * rather than general-purpose. - Dependency Inversion principle. A class should
 * depend upon abstractions, not implementations.
