  // @todo #510:30min Let's implement a test for small-size pull requests.
  //  At moment it's not possible because it requires to construct specific
  //  json for PR with fields 'additions' and 'deletions' via MkStorage.
  //  Also `add_new_pull_request_to_wbs` should be fixed.
  //  See https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/#get-a-single-pull-request
