To run a jar file double click on it, the results of the elaboration is provided in the proper log file. "AnagramFinder.jar" logs into "anagrams.log", "AnagramsFinderTests.jar" logs into "tests.log". Logs files will be created into "log" folder. These ones, if not existing, will be created by the program. 

A configuration file named "anagrams.properties" is provided for "AnagramsFinder.jar". This file allows you to select the file which contains the words to process. If you want to run "AnagramsFinder.jar" or "AnagramsFinderTest.jar" please make sure that "sample.txt" and "anagrams.properties" are in the same directory of the jar, otherwise an error will occur.

To execute the jars Java 8 is required.
