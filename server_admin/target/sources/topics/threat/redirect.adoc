=== Unspecific Redirect URIs

For the <<_oidc-auth-flows,Authorization Code Flow>>, if you register redirect URIs that
are too general, then it would be possible for a rogue client to impersonate a different client that has a broader scope
of access.  This could happen for instance if two clients live under the same domain.  So, it's a good idea to make your
registered redirect URIs as specific as feasible.
