[[_delete-user]]

=== Deleting Users

To delete a user click on `Users` in the left menu bar.

.Users

This menu option brings you to the user list page. Click `View all users` or search to find the user you intend to delete.

.Add User

In the list of users, click `Delete` next to the user you want to remove. You will be asked to confirm that you are sure you want to delete this user. Click `Delete` in the confirmation box to confirm.

NOTE: Deleting the user will take immediate effect, but may not invalidate all active sessions. For OIDC, there is the timeout for access tokens. For SAML, there is a potential for an application to not have registered a back channel logout URL, in which case the session would remain open until it expires in the application.
