==== GitLab

There are a number of steps you have to complete to be able to login to GitLab.  First, go to the `Identity Providers` left menu item
and select `GitLab` from the `Add provider` drop down list.  This will bring you to the `Add identity provider` page.

You can't click save yet, as you'll need to obtain a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from GitLab.  One piece of data you'll need from this
page is the `Redirect URI`.  You'll have to provide that to GitLab when you register {project_name} as a client there, so
copy this URI to your clipboard.

To enable login with GitLab you first have to register an application project in
https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html[GitLab as OAuth2 authentication service provider].

NOTE: GitLab often changes the look and feel of application registration, so these directions might not always be up to date and the
      configuration steps might be slightly different.


.Add a New App

You'll have to copy the `Redirect URI` from the {project_name} `Add Identity Provider` page and enter it into the
`Authorization callback URL` field on the GitLab `Register a new OAuth application` page.  Once you've completed this
page you will be brought to the application's management page.

You will need to obtain the client ID and secret from this page so you can enter them into the {project_name} `Add identity provider` page.
Go back to {project_name} and specify those items.
