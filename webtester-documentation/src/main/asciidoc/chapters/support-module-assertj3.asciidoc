=== AssertJ 3 Assertions

The support module `webtester-support-assertj3` provides AssertJ 3 assertion
implementations for many properties of page fragments:

* `ButtonAssert`
* `GenericTextFieldAssert`
* `MultiSelectAssert`
* `PageFragmentAssert`
* `SelectableAssert`
* `SingleSelectAssert`

All of these can be accessed through a single utility class named
`WebTesterAssertions`. Which extends AssertJ's Assertions class and therefore
provides all of AssertJ's default assertions as well.
