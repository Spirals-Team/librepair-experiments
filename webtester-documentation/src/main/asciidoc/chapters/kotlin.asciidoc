== Kotlin

Since version 2.3 WebTester supports the use of Kotlin. Up until then the
declarative nature of WebTester would not work with the way Kotlin is implementing
default methods on interfaces.

In order to work with Kotlin, you must add the `webtester-kotlin` module to your
test dependencies. Within this module you'll find two classes:

* `info.novatec.testit.webtester.kotlin.pages.Page`
* `info.novatec.testit.webtester.kotlin.pagefragments.PageFragment`

Both of these are alias classes for their corresponding Java counterparts.
In addition to providing a more Kotlin-esk API, their use will also act as
a flag for WebTester to consider Kotlin when it's generating code.

Other than using these special classes when creating pages and page fragments,
everything else should work the same as with Java.
