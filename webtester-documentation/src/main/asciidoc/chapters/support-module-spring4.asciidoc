=== Spring 4 Integration

==== Spring Configuration Adapter

The `webtester-support-spring4` module provides a `ConfigurationAdapter`
implementation called `SpringEnvironmentConfigurationAdapter`. This adapter can
be used to resolve properties from the existing `Configuration` against a Spring
`Environment`. All keys which could successfully be resolved against the
environment will then be overridden in the configuration.

[source, properties]
----
# WebTester Configuration
foo = hello world!
bar = welcome world!

# Spring Environment
foo = hello spring world!

# Resulting Configuration
foo = hello spring world!
bar = welcome world!
----

==== Factory Beans

In addition to the configuration adapter the module also provides `FactoryBean`
implementations which can be used to easily initialize different WebTester
services as beans.

* `DefaultSpringConfigurationFactoryBean`
* `ConfigurationBuilderFactoryBean`
* `PrototypeConfigurationBuilderFactoryBean`

===== DefaultSpringConfigurationFactoryBean

Creates a `Configuration` instance which results from using the
`DefaultConfigurationBuilder` in conjunction with the
`SpringEnvironmentConfigurationAdapter`.

===== ConfigurationBuilderFactoryBean

Creates a singleton `ConfigurationBuilder` instance. `ConfigurationAdapter` and
`ConfigurationExporter` beans can be added via setters.

===== PrototypeConfigurationBuilderFactoryBean

Creates a prototyped `ConfigurationBuilder` instance. `ConfigurationAdapter` and
`ConfigurationExporter` beans can be added via setters.
