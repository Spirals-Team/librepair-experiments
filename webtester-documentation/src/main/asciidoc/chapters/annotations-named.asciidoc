=== @Named

This annotation can be added to `@IdentifyUsing` annotated `PageFragment`
returning methods of `Page` or `PageFragment` subclasses in order to override
the name of the returned fragment.

_Collections of fragments can't be named at the moment!_

This is useful in cases where the element IDs are not very clear or event
cryptic. The name is used in any logs where the fragment is referenced. As well
as events fired by the framework.

*Example*

[source, java]
----
public interface FooPage extends Page {

    @Named("The Foo Widget 42")
    @IdentifyUsing("#foo")
    FooWidget widget();

    ...

}
