=== @Action

This annotation can be added to methods of `Page` or `PageFragment` subclasses
in order to mark these methods as actions. Currently the only effect of this
annotation the option to delay the execution of annotated methods by setting the
property `actions.deceleration` to a certain amount of milliseconds.

*Examples*

[source, java]
----
// actions work on pages...
public interface FooPage extends Page {

    @Action
    default void doSomething() {
        ...
    }

}

// ... as well as on page fragments
public interface BarFragment extends PageFragment {

    @Action
    default void doSomething() {
        ...
    }

}
