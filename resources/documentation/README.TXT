Welcome to Anonimatron. So you've downloaded this 
distribution to anonymize your data, now what?

*** Installation ***
Since you're reading this, we assume that you unpacked 
the release. That means you're done. There is no 
"installation" of anonimatron. It will run out of any folder, 
as long as you keep the folder structure in here identical 
so anonimatron can find it's JDBC drivers and jar files.

*** Usage ***
Anonimatron is a command line tool, with a few command line
options. Running "anonimatron.bat", or "./anonimatron.sh" will
present you with a list of possible command line options.

If you've never used anonimatron before, please check out
the -configexample command line option, which will show
you what drivers are supported, and prints out a demo XML
file which should give you a few good pointers at how
to set things up. All data types known by anonimatron
at the time of running the command are automatically listed.

Have fun playing with anonimatron, and don't forget to
post bugs or feature requests at 
http://anonimatron.sourceforge.net/

Kind regards,
The anonimatron team.


*** FAQ ***

What's with the spelling?
Anonimatron is deliberately mis-spelled, so as to be able to
use it as a product- and brand name without colliding with 
other products. Within the software, we use American English 
so the correct spelling is: 
 - anonymize
 - anonymizer
 - anonymous
 - anonymization
