A simple telegram bot for fetching price information about crypto currencies from CoinMarketCap. 

![Alt text](/screenshots/example.png?raw=true "Bot Example - Formatted as a String or rendered as an Image")


As seen above the result can be displayed in 2 different ways:
1. Formatted as a String with a Link to CoinMarketCap. Use double slash // for the command. I.e. //eth 
2. Rendered as an Image. Just use a single slash / for the command. I.e. /eth

You can try it out  [here](https://telegram.me/PriceLeechBot).


## Installation

In order to run the bot, you have to set your telegram bot api token as an environment variable:
