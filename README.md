# Eclipse Paho Java Client
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/eclipse/paho.mqtt.java)

The Paho Java Client is an MQTT client library written in Java for developing applications that run on the JVM or other Java compatible platforms such as Android. This Project contains a number of Maven projects allowing you to use and test MQTTv3 and MQTTv5.

## Project description:

The Paho project has been created to provide reliable open-source implementations of open and standard messaging protocols aimed at new, existing, and emerging applications for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT).
Paho reflects the inherent physical and cost constraints of device connectivity. Its objectives include effective levels of decoupling between devices and applications, designed to keep markets open and encourage the rapid growth of scalable Web and Enterprise middleware and applications.

## Client Libraries and Utilities
 - [MQTTv3 Library](MQTTv3.md) - The Original Paho MQTTv3 Library, supports MQTT version 3.1 and 3.1.1.
 - [MQTTv5 Library](MQTTv5.md) - The New Paho MQTTv5 Library based on the original, Currently under active development, supports MQTT version 5.
 - [Paho Utility App](org.eclipse.paho.sample.utility/utility.md) - A useful lightweight MQTT GUI utility. (V3 Only)
 - [Paho Eclipse View](org.eclipse.paho.client.eclipse.view) - An Eclipse View similar to the Utility. (V3 Only)
 - [Mqttv3app](org.eclipse.paho.sample.mqttv3app) - Sample Application using the MQTTv3 Client.
