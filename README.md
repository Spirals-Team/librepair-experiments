# Signs@Work
Signs@Work is a dynamic dictionary of Sign Language on the social network dedicated to employees or business sectors.
It aims at facilitating work for deaf employees and their interpreters, in their everyday life. 
Because Sign Language is a living language and need to be adjusted to working environment, specific business or scientific terms need to be created and shared through Sign Language community.
Signs@Work will provide tools to propose a sign, to make a request about a concept/term, and to vote the proposed neologism.
