## Advantages of Bucket4j
* Implemented on top of ideas of well known algorithm, which are by de-facto standard for rate limiting in the IT industry.
* Effective lock-free implementation, Bucket4j is good scalable for multithreading case.
* Absolutely non-compromise precision, Bucket4j does not operate with floats or doubles, all calculation are performed in the integer arithmetic,
this feature protects end users from calculation errors involved by rounding.
* Ability to switch from one JVM to cluster in two lines of code. Using Bucket4j you are able to limiting something in the cluster of JVMs.
Since [release 1.2](https://github.com/vladimir-bukhtoyarov/bucket4j/releases/tag/1.2.0) the ```Bucket4j``` supports any GRID solution which compatible with [JCache API (JSR 107)](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107) specification.
Just use your favorite grid including [Hazelcast](http://hazelcast.com/products/hazelcast/), [Ignite](https://ignite.apache.org/), [Coherence](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/coherence/overview/index.html), [Infinispan](http://infinispan.org/) or any other.
* Ability to specify multiple bandwidths per bucket. For example you can limit 1000 events per hours but not often then 100 events per minute.
* Both synchronous and asynchronous API.

## Supported back-ends
As mentioned above in addition to local in-memory buckets, the Bucket4j supports clustered usage scenario on top of following back-ends:
 
| Back-end                   | Documentation page                                  | Async supported |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | :-------------: |
| ```JCache API (JSR 107)``` | [bucket4j-jcache](doc-pages/jcache-usage.md)        | No              |
| ```Hazelcast```            | [bucket4j-hazelcast](doc-pages/hazelcast.md)        | Yes             |
| ```Apache Ignite```        | [bucket4j-ignite](doc-pages/ignite.md)              | Yes             |
| ```Inifinispan```          | [bucket4j-infinspan](doc-pages/infinispan.md)       | Yes             | 

## General documentation
#### Basics:
* [Token bucket wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) - wikipedia page describes the token-bucket algorithm in classical form.
* [Non-formal overview of token-bucket algorithm](doc-pages/token-bucket-brief-overview.md) - the brief overview of token-bucket algorithm.

#### Examples:
* [Basic-usage](doc-pages/basic-usage.md) - examples of basic usage.
* [Advanced-usage](doc-pages/advanced-usage.md) - examples of advanced usage.
* [Asynchronous-usage](doc-pages/asynchronous.md) - examples of asynchronous usage.

#### Production checklist
* [Common production checklist](doc-pages/production-generic-checklist.md) - Mandatory points that need to be understood before using the Bucket4j in production, independently of local or clustered usage scenarios.
* [JCache production checklist](doc-pages/production-jcache-checklist.md) - Mandatory points that need to be understood before using the Bucket4j over JCache cluster.

#### Archive:
* [Documentation for legacy releases](doc-pages/archive-links.md).

## Third-party integrations:
* [MarcGiffing/Spring Boot Starter for Bucket4j](https://github.com/MarcGiffing/bucket4j-spring-boot-starter) . Demos of usage (incluing Zuul and Hazelcast) can be found there [bucket4j-spring-boot-starter-examples](https://github.com/MarcGiffing/bucket4j-spring-boot-starter-examples).
