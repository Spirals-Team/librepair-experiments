## Git-Style-Guide
For the moment see [agis-:Git-Style-Guide](https://github.com/agis-/git-style-guide) and use it with the following exceptions:
 - Subject to commits is in form: `{JIRA-Ticket} {Ticket summary} {Commit summary}`, like `MCR-1393 Git-Migration add .travis.yml`
 - Branch name to work on a ticket is in form: `issues/{JIRA-Ticket}-{Ticket Summary}`, like `issues/MCR-1393-Git-Migration`

Stay tuned for more information. :bow:
