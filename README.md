> If you are sending in large numbers of requests it is particularly important that we have some way of contacting you - otherwise, in the event of problems, the only alternative is to ban your IP and wait for you to contact us.

Java & Android
--------------

I don't use it anymore in android app but it should still be compatible with Android.
