# Project:
**Learning Outcomes Management System**:

Represent the structure of a Department, and be able to track, edit and update the Learning Outcomes (objectives) of the programs being offered. Learning Outcomes are arranged in Categories and are offered by one or many courses in a given year, where a course belongs to one or many programs. A user can view all the details, but only an Administrator can make changes.

# Product Backlog:

> Stories are arranged according to Priority.
> Sizing technique used: Planning Poker with 
> Arbitrary size: T-shirt sizes (S, M, L, XL, XXL)
> Sizing done by Team while backlog grooming during Sprint weekly meetings
> NOTE: Stories are not concrete, and open to re-prioritization and re-sizing based on the chance that the needs and efforts are overlooked

# Sprint 1

## Goal: Display list of Learning Outcomes
Aim was to have the initial setup of the project completed; which included proper version control repo, integrated with Travis CI, and the app should be up and running in production on Heroku. Along with having the first feature of having the ability to work with the backend and display information to the user after logging in, which includes the list of programs and learning outcomes for the time being. Already populated with a very small list of learning outcomes.

**Stories worked on:**
  - Story Number 1 - [As a user, I should be able to login to the app, so that I can display different lists of information related to the department ](https://github.com/sheikhfaisalanwar/SYSC4806/projects/2#card-7842757)
  - Story Number 2 - [As a user, I should be able to view all the programs that are available, so that I can see the students registered in them ](https://github.com/sheikhfaisalanwar/SYSC4806/projects/2#card-7950431)
  - Story Number 3 - [As a user, I should be able to list all learning outcomes, so that I can see all that are required ](https://github.com/sheikhfaisalanwar/SYSC4806/projects/2#card-7950442)

# Sprint 2

## Goal: Overall ability completed from a user's perspective to view different parts of the entire department


## Plans:
Have integration tests in place, complete Program domain model and establish relationships between courses, programs, years, categories, and learning outcomes. Hopefully also implement Administrator privileges to edit the list, and have a user only be able to view all the information. The specific lists the user is able to view need to be established as well, after the relationships and the domain models are set up.
The relationships to establish are:
  - Multiple programs in the department
  - Each course has a Set of learning objectives in a given year
  - Each learning objective belongs to a category
  - Each course belongs to one or many programs, and a program has many courses in a given year
  - Course is taught in a given year

We will also setup and maintain UML diagrams.

**Stories worked on:**
  - Story Number 2 - [As a user, I should be able to view all the programs that are available, so that I can see the students registered in them ](https://github.com/sheikhfaisalanwar/SYSC4806/projects/2#card-7950431)

  - Story Number 6 - [As a user, I should be able to list learning outcomes for a specific program, so that I can see the outcomes required by the program ](https://github.com/sheikhfaisalanwar/SYSC4806/projects/1#card-7840901)
