## Disclaimer

This is an academic project done during the Software Engineering & Professional Practice subject at [Universidad de Sevilla](https://www.informatica.us.es). The result of the development (know as the Service) is deployed but it's no longer supported. There is no warranty for any of the provided services, as the payment system.

## The idea

**Whenever there is a driver available, you can send your package where you want.**

The idea was born after one of the members of Shipmee forgot his cell charger. He was going to spend the weekend in his hometown and he realized that it was cheaper to buy another charger! Why can't I ask someone to bring my actual charger? Nowadays, we can ask someone we don't know to drive us anywhere, why can't we do the same with our belongings? That was the seed where Shipmee was born from.

## What makes our project better that our competency?

1. **You can create routes, besides creating shipment:**  
In traditional apps, the user that want to carry something have the power. He or she choose what to ship, where to ship it and when to ship it but, what happen if you have a trip and there is nobody who wants to ship something? In Shipmee, you can post a route where you announce your trip, your schedule and the available size to carry things. Other users can see your trips and ask for your service. Both has the power.
2. **You don't like the price? Propose your own:**  
Sometimes you find someone perfect to carry your belonging but it's a little bit pricey. In a face to face conversation, you could ask him or her to lower the price. In Shipmee, we have a built-in haggling system where you can do exactly the same. You can post counter offers and get them accepted.
3. **Your money, your rules:**  
People wants to spend their money in what they want, not in something someone choose for them. In Shipmee, we have a payment system where you will pay after you decide that the service is what you desire. When posting a shipment, you will pay after you accept an offer. When choosing a route, you pay after you choose an offer (Don't worry, if your offer is not accepted, you get your money back).
4. **The driver don't get the money until the service has been successful:**  
What happen if you get your beloging broken? Then, you can cancel the payment and get your money back. If the service is good, it's a good idea to accept the payment next to the driver. They helped you and deserve to be paid.

## Technologies

Shipmee is a web service that it's been possible thanks all these technologies.

In Backend:
- Java, as the main programming language.
- Spring MVC, as our MVC framework.
- MySQL, as our Database Management System.
- Hibernate, as our framework to connect Java and MySQL.

In FrontEnd:
- The well-known HTML, CSS and JavaScript combination.
- Bootstrap, as the tool to make our web responsive.

Other technologies we used:
- Github, as our code repository.
- DigitalOcean and Heroku, where we deployed the Service.
- Travis CI, as our continuos integration service.
- SonarQube, as our continuous inspection of code quality service.
- Coveralls, as our test coverage service.
