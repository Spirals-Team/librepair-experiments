## Setting up the project
Simply add this project as a maven project to your IDE. 

**Project Folder:** 
   
    softwareengineering/DigitalJournal

After your _IDE_ has finished fetching all maven dependencies a new Run Configuration should appear. 
It is called **DigitalJournalApplication**.

### Additional requirements

#### Lombok Plugin

Install the Lombok Plugin in your IDE. 
In IntelliJ go to
 * Help
 * find Action
 * search for _"Plugins"_ and  click on the result
 * Click on _browse repositories..._ at the bottom of the newly created window
 * Search for _Lombok Plugin_
 * Install it and restart


#### Hot Swapping Code

In order to stop restarting the server by hand every time a change in code happens, the following needs to be done.

##### Live Reload

Install the [Live Reload](http://livereload.com/extensions/) plugin in your browser.

Make sure you enable it whenever you want to see live changes!
