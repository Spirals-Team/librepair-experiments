Summary
-------

JWKTL (Java-based Wiktionary Library) is an application programming 
interface for the free  multilingual online dictionary Wiktionary
(https://www.wiktionary.org). Wiktionary is collaboratively constructed 
by volunteers and continually growing. JWKTL enables efficient and 
structured access to the information encoded in the English and German Wiktionary language editions, including sense definitions, 
part of speech tags, etymology, example sentences, translations, 
semantic relations, and many other lexical information types. The 
API was first described in an LREC 2008 paper.

Project Background
------------------

Prior to being available as open source software, JWKTL was a research 
project at the Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing (UKP) Lab of Technische 
Universität Darmstadt, Germany under the auspices of Prof. Iryna Gurevych.
Since being open source software, JWKTL is developed by multiple contributors 
(see CONTRIBUTORS.txt for details).
