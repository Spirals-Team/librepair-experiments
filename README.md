## About 'Aero-dev'
### Intro
<p>
This project is the result of my half-year internship studying, where I gleaned a lot of
knowledge.
My lead purpose was to improve my Java development skills and become
'junior/middle'
developer.
During my internship I also learned to use new languages such as: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and
other.
I'm sure, that it is a nice start to improve my skills and become a
'senior'
developer eventually.

### Concept
<p>
This is a web portal for engineers, who works in <strong>aeronautical engineering</strong>. The
main
idea is:
<em>"Skills sharing, projects market, career."</em>
</p>
<h6>Skills sharing</h6>
<p>
In short, every engineer can add his project to his profile and share with it to everybody as
well as he can watch for projects
of another engineers. Also they can collaborate in some projects or start discussions. In this
way engineer can
improve his grade and skills.
</p>
<h6>Projects market</h6>
<p>
Engineer can make some projects as private (nobody can explore it, just a little description).
But if somebody quite interested
in engineer's projects, then he can buy it to have full explore access. So this implies a market
of such projects.
</p>
<p>
Every project consists from description, some images and files. Project type describe
aeronautic's field such as:

* aerodynamics
* aeroelasticity
* acoustics
* design
* strength of structures
* technology
</p>
<h6>Career</h6>
<p>
Also in this portal company representatives (CR) are present. This is a users with a little bit
more privileges than engineers.
CR represents his company and he is interested in well quality projects and qualified engineers
respectively. CR can make offer
to chosen engineer for further cooperation. Maybe lucky engineer can became a part of CR's
company.
</p>
<p>
All companies in this portal are strictly related with aeronautical industry.
