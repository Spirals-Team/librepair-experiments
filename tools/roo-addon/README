This is the Jolokia Roo-Addon. It allows to introduce a Jolokia agent
servlet agent to an existing Web-Project.

The single command provided is 

 jolokia setup 

which will be available as soon as a WEB-INF/web.xml is there. This 
command will add the necessary dependencies to the pom.xml (upgrading
any if there is already a Jolokia dependency in place to the Jolokia version
associated with this addon) and adapt WEB-INF/web.xml to include a mapping
to the Jolokia agent under "/jolokia".

The command knows about these options:

  --addAccessPolicy       This will add a sample "jolokia-access.xml" into
                          resources/ with no restrictions. It can be
                          adapted to configure fine granular access
                          security to the agent

  --addDefaultInitParams  With this options the servlet definition
                          will contain the possible init parameters
                          with their default values

  --addJsr160Proxy        The servlet will be prepared so that it can
                          act as a JSR-160 Proxy as well
