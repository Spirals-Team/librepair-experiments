# Apiman Development Server

This is the former home of the API Manager and API Gateway development servers.  These two modules have
been removed in favor of the set of Development Servers found here:

https://github.com/apiman/apiman-servers

Please see the above link for how to start up standalone apiman servers for testing purposes.  If you
can't figure out how to use the servers found in the above link, please let us know on the [mailing
list](https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/apiman-user) or in [IRC](http://www.apiman.io/latest/chat.html)!
