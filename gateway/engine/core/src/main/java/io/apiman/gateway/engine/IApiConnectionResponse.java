/**
 * A API connection response represents the result of a successful connection
 * to a back-end API.  The connection response is a {@link ApiResponse} object
 * as well as a stream of data (the response payload/body).
 *
 * One of these is passed asynchronously to apiman *after* the API connection is
 * established, all request body data is written, and the back-end API responds
 * successfully.
 *
 * The {@link ApiResponse} MUST be made available via the getHead() method and
 * should be available immediately.
 *
 * The response payload/body is delivered asynchronously.  apiman will add asynchronous
 * body and end handlers to this connection response and then call transmit().  Once
 * transmit() is called, that is the signal to the implementation of this interface
 * to go ahead and start sending the data to the body handler.  Once all data is written,
 * an implementation MUST call the end handler.
 *
 * If an error occurs during data transmission, apiman WILL call the abort() method
 * of this interface, providing an opportunity for implementations to close down the
 * connection and free up any resources.
 *
 * There is no close() method, so an implementation is responsible for ensuring that
 * all of its resources are freed prior to calling the end handler.
