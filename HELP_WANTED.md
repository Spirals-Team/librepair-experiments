We Need Your Help!
==================

This page lists a few things that could still be done and that nobody
is actively working on.  It is not exhaustive at all and if you want
to work on something that is not on this list, that's absolutely
fine - maybe drop us a line on the XMLUnit general list so we can
avoid duplicate or wasted effort.

In General
----------

* work on the open issues

Java
----

* additional hamcrest matchers

.NET
