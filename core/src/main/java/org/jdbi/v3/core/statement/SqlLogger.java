/**
 * SqlLoggers receive query data before and after a query is executed, and after an exception is thrown by a bad query.
 *
 * Defined attributes (see {@link SqlStatement#define(String, Object)}) and bound {@link org.jdbi.v3.core.argument.Argument}s (see {@link SqlStatement#bind(String, Object)}) are available on the {@link StatementContext}, along with timing information using {@link java.time.Instant}s. It's recommendable to use {@link java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit#between} to measure elapsed time in your unit of choice, as in {@link StatementContext#getElapsedTime}.
 *
 * See also {@link org.jdbi.v3.core.argument.LoggableArgument}. They can enable you to log previously unloggable {@link org.jdbi.v3.core.argument.Argument}s by wrapping them with a value in {@link org.jdbi.v3.core.argument.ArgumentFactory}s.
