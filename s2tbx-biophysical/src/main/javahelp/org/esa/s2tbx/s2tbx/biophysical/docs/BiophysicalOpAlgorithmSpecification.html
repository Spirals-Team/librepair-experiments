<p>
    The proposed algorithm is based on methods that have already been proven to be efficient.
</p>
<p>
    They have been implemented to generate biophysical products from VEGETATION, MERIS, SPOT, and LANDSAT sensors.
    It mainly consists in generating a comprehensive database of vegetation characteristics
    and the associated SENTINEL2 top of canopy (TOC) reflectances.
    Neural networks are then trained to estimate the canopy characteristics from the
    TOC reflectances along with set corresponding angles defining the observational configuration.
</p>
<p>
    For each biophysical variable, one particular neural network is calibrated.
    Each neural network is composed of :
    <ul>
        <li>
            one input layer, made of 11 normalized input data :
            B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8a, B11, B12,
            cos(viewing_zenith), cos(sun_zenith), cos(relative_azimuth_angle)
        </li>
        <li>
            one hidden layer with 5 neurons with tangent sigmoid transfer functions
        </li>
        <li>
            one output layer with a linear transfer function
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    The actual algorithm running in SNAP runs the prediction step of the neural network, from the set
    of precomputed coefficients computed during the training phase.
