    "message": "Corfu global log scanner & replica repair.\n\nFor all intervals in the global Corfu log address space,\nthe interval is either in a healthy state (as scanned by some\nrepair worker at an earlier time), or its state is unknown.\nA SMRMap called 'globalState' is used to track healthy/unknown\nstate, in addition to a map of intervals where a worker process\nis believed to be working on scanning & repairing data in that\ninterval.\n\nA worker processes has an interval size that it prefers to\nwork with. (No need to use same size interval size with other\nworkers.)  A worker consults the unknown map and adds an\ninterval to the working map.  When the quorum repair scan\nis complete, a worker removes the interval from working\nand adds it to healthy.\n\nIntervals that sit in the working map for too long are\nconsidered failed and re-eligible to be scanned.  A reliable\ndetector of worker faults isn't needed: duplicate scans can't\ndamage Corfu data.",
