    "message": "Merge branch 'develop' into feature/fid-pipeline\n\n* develop: (105 commits)\n  Temporarily disable the Bottom Vision pre-rotate feature until it's working correctly. See https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/401.\n  Added the ability to set speeds for each nozzle tip changer movement. Defaults to 1.0, producing the same behavior as before.\n  Changed label of System output checkbox fixing capitalization and removing superfluous \"enable\" word. Refactored code a bit to make it compatible with WindowBuilder.\n  Changes suggested by @vonnieda to SystemLogger simplifying the print mechanics\n  remove unnecessary out reference in System Logger\n  Fix the double line breaks from the script runners Fix the StackOverflow on shutdown where Logger gets called but is no longer available (exception loop)\n  Reverted ReferenceBottomVision.java to upstream/develop\n  Removed previousStage, currentStage and alias `..`, as @cri-s getWorkingModel() implements their intended functionality.\n  Added @cri-s getWorkingModel()\n  Re-enable #571 after reviewing proposed changed by @BendRocks. Standard bottom vision is now back to how it was, and is working, and pre-rotate appears to be working correctly as well.\n  Revert the change originally made in #571, see notes in code.\n  Fixed #575, pre-rotation now includes fiducial compensation. Refactored the fid compensation code into it's own function and applied it in both places it's used.\n  Fix an NPE in ReferenceBottomVision when board location or placement location is null, as in when being called from the wizard. Set SimulatedUpCamera to default to Looking Up, because obviously.\n  Reformatting pass before making a few small changes.\n  Renamed an abbreviated property to it's non-abbreviated form for clarify.\n  Ugh. Fixed typo that prevented compile\n  Fix comment\n  Fixed merge issue\n  Tested on hardware, using both 0, +45 (ccw) and -45deg (cw) pcb rotation.\n  Signed-off-by: BendRocks <BendRocks@users.noreply.github.com>\n  ...\n\n# Conflicts:\n#\tsrc/main/java/org/openpnp/gui/PartsPanel.java\n#\tsrc/main/java/org/openpnp/vision/pipeline/CvPipeline.java",
