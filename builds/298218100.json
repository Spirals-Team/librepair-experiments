    "message": "#340 - Polishing.\n\nMoved AffordanceModelFactory into core package as it's SPI. Switched to Spring Factories lookup of implementation classes so that we avoid a package dependency between the MVC package and the media type specific packages. Removed reference to MediaType from AffordanceModelFactory to AffordanceModel so that a factory can even provide models for different MediaTypes (i.e. different flavors of the same one, e.g. HAL Forms for JSON and XML). Also removed addAffordanceModel(…) from Affordance to not force the implementations into mutability. Made most of the affordance building API types package protected. HalFormsAffordanceModel now uses MethodParameters abstraction to simplify model parsing code.\n\nTweaked HAL forms model to work with factory methods for required properties and wither methods to add optional properties. Tweaked and inlined mixin types in Jackson module for HAL forms.\n\nSlight API polishing on Link to make sure Affordance collecting methods are not named with….\n\nTweaked Lombok setup to use all caps for logger constants. Removed deprecation warnings in Jackson2HalModule.",
