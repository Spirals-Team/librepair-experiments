    "message": "Transaction Abort Exception Cause for slow writers\n\nThe cause CONFLICT is reported whenever two transaction conflict over\nthe same keys for a given stream(s). This change corrects the overload\nof this abort cause for the case of slow writers, i.e., whenever a\nwriter fails to write given that the designated address is continuously\noverwritten (perhaps hole filled) by a faster reader. This is due to the\nfact that it is not really conflicting with any other stream, the cause\nof abort is that you are overwritten by a fast reader in the system.",
