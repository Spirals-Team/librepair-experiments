    "message": "Merge branch 'develop' into feature/sim-cam-work\n\n* develop: (44 commits)\n  Finish merge of CvPipeline variables in code that had not yet been migrated.\n  Updated licenses as per comment from @dzach in https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/573#issuecomment-311633280\n  One minor revert missed.\n  Bring back the ReferenceLoosePartFeeder stuff since the changes are now in Advanced*\n  Move new loose feeder stuff into AdvancedLoosePartFeeder\n  Renamed several stages to be more descriptive. Minor text updates.\n  Revert \"Fixes DrawTemplateMatches stage drawing at corner rather than centered.\"\n  Remove dead comments. Add some handy getters and setters in prep for variable support.\n  Checkpoing from last night. Adds all the neccesary support to add variables to pipelines via commons beanutils PropertyUtils.getProperty(). The idea is to add a new variableOverrides map to CvStage which will be used to apply a variable to a specific property. This map will be managed from the UI, requiring changes to the property editor component. This will allow us to keep the strongly typed properties but override them with variable values when needed.\n  Moved default pipelines into the right place. Updated feeder and wizard code to handle the training pipeline.\n  Basic code cleanup and reformatting. Moved the thrice duplicated matMaxima into OpenCvUtils and updated references to it.\n  Added default path for reading in templates and logging option to ReadTemplateImage.\n  Added default path for templates to WriteTemplateImage\n  Added ability to create a template for rect parts from package body\n  WriteTemplateImage: Added the ability to use package ID for automatic name creation for a template\n  Added the ability to use package ID for automatic name creation for a template\n  Added orientation line to DrawRotatedRects\n  Fixed error in logic, returning the originally detected model instead of null. That lead to false part orientation.\n  TemplateFile path was overwritten by file name in WriteTemplateImage\n  Fixed caused by reusing object\n  ...",
