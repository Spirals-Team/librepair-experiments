    "message": "Updated kraken.json\n\nKraken removed some pairs: \r\n\r\nIn order to help mitigate the strain on our platform caused by recent exponential\r\ngrowth, we are delisting some of our illiquid trading pairs and temporarily\r\nsuspending all advanced order types. *These changes will go into effect on Tuesday,\r\nAugust 22 around 6 am UTC (Monday August 21 around 11 pm Pacific).*\r\n\r\n# The following pairs will be delisted with all outstanding orders being canceled\r\n\r\n* XBT/GBP\r\n* ETH/GBP\r\n* XRP/CAD\r\n* XRP/JPY\r\n* EOS/EUR\r\n* EOS/USD\r\n* XLM/EUR\r\n* XLM/USD\r\n* GNO/EUR\r\n* GNO/USD\r\n* REP/USD\r\n\r\n# The ability to create new advanced orders will also be temporarily suspended (so\r\nyou will only be able to create basic limit and market orders)\r\n\r\nOpen orders will remain open until cancelled or executed, but you will no longer be\r\nable to create new orders in any of the following advanced types:\r\n\r\n* Stop Loss\r\n* Take Profit\r\n* Stop Loss, Take Profit\r\n* Stop Loss, Take Profit Limit\r\n* Stop Loss Limit\r\n* Take Profit Limit\r\n* Trailing Stop\r\n* Trailing Stop Limit\r\n* Stop, Limit\r\n\r\nThis suspension is temporary only. Advanced orders will return in a month or two as\r\nsoon as we are better able to process them. We know that many of our clients like\r\nthe advanced orders, but they are used much less frequently than basic limit and\r\nmarket orders while taking more system resources to process.\r\n\r\n*The above changes will go into effect on Tuesday, August 22 around 6 am UTC (Monday\r\nAugust 21 around 11 pm Pacific).*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for choosing Kraken,\r\n\r\nThe Kraken Team",
