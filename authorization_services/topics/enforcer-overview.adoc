= Policy Enforcers

Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) is a design pattern and as such you can implement it in different ways. {project_name} provides all the necessary means
to implement PEPs for different platforms, environments, and programming languages. {project_name} Authorization Services presents a RESTful API,
and leverages OAuth2 authorization capabilities for fine-grained authorization using a centralized authorization server.

A PEP is responsible for enforcing access decisions from the {project_name} server where these decisions are taken by evaluating the policies
associated with a protected resource. It acts as a filter or interceptor in your application in order to check whether or not a particular request
to a protected resource can be fulfilled based on the permissions granted by these decisions.

If you are using any of the {project_name} OIDC adapters, you can easily enable the policy enforcer by adding the following property to your *keycloak.json* file:

.keycloak.json
```json
{
 "policy-enforcer": {}
}
```

When you enable the policy enforcer all requests sent your application are intercepted and access to protected resources will be granted
depending on the permissions granted by {project_name} to the identity making the request.

Policy enforcement is strongly linked to your application's paths and the <<_resource_overview, resources>> you created for a resource server using the {project_name} Administration Console. By default,
when you create a resource server, {project_name} creates a <<_resource_server_default_config, default configuration>> for your resource server so you can enable policy enforcement quickly.
