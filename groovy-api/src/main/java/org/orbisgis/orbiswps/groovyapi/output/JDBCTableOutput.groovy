/**
 * JDBCTable output annotation.
 * The JDBCTable complex model represents any model source (database, file ...).
 * As an output, this annotation should be placed just before the variable.
 *
 * The following fields must be defined (mandatory) :
 *  - title : String[]
 *       Title of a process, input, and output. Normally available for display to a human. It is composed either a
 *       unique title or a translated title, its language, another title, its language ...
 *       i.e. title = "title" or tittle = ["titleFr", "fr", "titleEn", "en"]
 *
 * The following fields can be defined (optional) :
 *  - description : String[]
 *      Brief narrative description of a process, input, and output. Normally available for display to a human.It is
 *      composed either a unique description or a translated description, its language, another description, its language ...
 *      i.e. description = "description" or description = ["descriptionFr", "fr", "descriptionEn", "en"]
 *
 *  - keywords : String[]
 *      Array of keywords that characterize a process, its inputs, and outputs. Normally available for display to a
 *      human. It is composed of a succession of two String : the human readable keyword list coma
 *      separated and its language.
 *      i.e. keywords = ["the keyword 1,the keyword 2", "en",
 *                       "le mot clef 1, le mot clef 2", "fr"]
 *  - identifier : String
 *      Unambiguous identifier of a process, input, and output. It should be a valid URI.
 *
 *  - metadata : String[]
 *      Reference to additional metadata about this item. It is composed of a succession of three String : the metadata
 *      role, the metadata title and the href, coma separated.
 *      i.e. metadata = ["role1,title,href1",
 *                       "role2,title,href2"]
 *
 * - dataTypes : String[]
 *      List of field type that should be contained by the JDBCTable.
 *
 * - excludedTypes : String[]
 *      List of field type forbidden for the JDBCTable. If the JDBCTable contains the type, it won't be available.
 *
 * Usage example can be found at https://github.com/orbisgis/orbisgis/wiki/
