/**
 * RawData input annotation.
 * The RawData is a complex model that represents a file or directory.
 * As an input, this annotation should be placed just before the variable.
 *
 * The following fields must be defined (mandatory) :
 *  - title : String[]
 *       Title of a process, input, and output. Normally available for display to a human. It is composed either a
 *       unique title or a translated title, its language, another title, its language ...
 *       i.e. title = "title" or tittle = ["titleFr", "fr", "titleEn", "en"]
 *
 * The following fields can be defined (optional) :
 *  - description : String[]
 *      Brief narrative description of a process, input, and output. Normally available for display to a human.It is
 *      composed either a unique description or a translated description, its language, another description, its language ...
 *      i.e. description = "description" or description = ["descriptionFr", "fr", "descriptionEn", "en"]
 *
 *  - keywords : String[]
 *      Array of keywords that characterize a process, its inputs, and outputs. Normally available for display to a
 *      human. It is composed of a succession of two String : the human readable keyword list coma
 *      separated and its language.
 *      i.e. keywords = ["the keyword 1,the keyword 2", "en",
 *                       "le mot clef 1, le mot clef 2", "fr"]
 *  - identifier : String
 *      Unambiguous identifier of a process, input, and output. It should be a valid URI.
 *
 *  - metadata : String[]
 *      Reference to additional metadata about this item. It is composed of a succession of three String : the metadata
 *      role, the metadata title and the href, coma separated.
 *      i.e. metadata = ["role1,title,href1",
 *                       "role2,title,href2"]
 *
 *  - minOccurs : int
 *      Minimum number of times that values for this parameter are required. 0 means the input is optional.
 *
 *  - maxOccurs : int
 *      Maximum number of times that this parameter may be present.
 *
 *  - isDirectory : boolean
 *      Indicates that the RawData can be a directory.
 *
 *  - isFile : boolean
 *      Indicates that the RawData can be a file.
 *
 *  - multiSelection : boolean
 *      Indicates that the user can select more than one file/directory.
 *
 *  - fileTypes : String[]
 *      Array of the file type allowed for the raw model. If no types are specified, accept all.
 *
 *  - excludedTypes : String[]
 *      Array of the file type not allowed for the raw model.
 *
 * Usage example can be found at https://github.com/orbisgis/orbisgis/wiki/
