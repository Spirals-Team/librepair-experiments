Welcome to DomUI
================
This is DomUI, a Java User Interface framework. Get the details at
http://www.domui.org/

The code and bug tracker can be found at Launchpad:
https://launchpad.net/domui

This software is released under the LGPL 2.1, a copy of this licence's
terms can be found in the file with this name. The gist of the license
is: use DomUI at will, you do not have to release the source to your own
code with the exception of additions or changes to DomUI itself.

A demo application can be found in the demo war folder. This is a
standalone war which can be installed in a web server, usually
just by copying the thing into the web server's "webapps" folder. 
The demo app will create a database (a Apache Derby database) at
startup, so the first invocation will be slow.
A hosted copy of this application can also be found at
http://www.domui.org/demo/
