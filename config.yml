############################################################################

### General Settings ###
general:
  # BSkyBlock uses bStats.org to get global data about the plugin to help improving it.
  # bStats has nearly no effect on your server's performance and the sent data is completely 
  # anonymous so please consider twice if you really want to disable it.
  metrics: true

  # Check for updates - this will tell Ops and the console if there is a new
  # version available. It contacts dev.bukkit.org to request the latest version
  # info. It does not download the latest version or change any files
  check-updates: true

  # Default language for new players.
  # This is the filename in the locale folder without .yml.
  # If this does not exist, the default en-US will be used.
  default-language: en-US

  # Use economy or not. If true, an economy plugin is required. If false, no money is used or give.
  # If there is no economy plugin present anyway, money will be automatically disabled.
  use-economy: true

  # Starting money - this is how much money new players will have as their
  # balance at the start of an island. 
  starting-money: 10.0

  # Use the control panel as the default display for /island
  # /island will always create an island if one does not exist
  # If the control panel is not used, then /island will teleport the player home
  # Players can change this setting using /island cp on or /island cp off
  # Changing this setting will only apply to new players.
  use-control-panel: true

  ### Purge-related Settings ###
  purge:
    # Only islands below this level will be removed if they are abandoned and admins issue the purge command
    max-island-level: 50

    # Remove user data when its island gets purged.
    # Helps a lot to avoid huge backups and can save some performance on startup,
    # but the player settings and data will be reset.
    remove-user-data: false

  ### Database-related Settings ###
  database:
    # FLATFILE, MYSQL, MONGO
    # if you use MONGO, you must also run the BSBMongo plugin (not addon)
    # See https://github.com/tastybento/bsbMongo/releases/
    type: FLATFILE
    host: localhost
    # Port 3306 is MySQL's default. Port 27017 is MongoDB's default.
    port: 3306
    name: BSkyBlock
    username: username
    password: password

    # How often the data will be saved to file in mins. Default is 5 minutes.
    # This helps prevent issues if the server crashes.
    # Data is also saved at important points in the game.
    backup-period: 5

  # Recover super flat - if the generator does not run for some reason, you can get
  # super flat chunks (grass). To remove automatically, select this option. Turn off
  # if there are no more because it may cause lag.
  # This will regenerate any chunks with bedrock at y=0 when they are loaded
  recover-super-flat: false

  # Mute death messages
  mute-death-messages: false

  # Allow FTB Autonomous Activator to work (will allow a pseudo player [CoFH] to place and break blocks and hang items)
  # Add other fake player names here if required
  fakeplayers:
  - "[CoFH]"
  
  # Allow obsidian to be scooped up with an empty bucket back into lava
  # This only works if there is a single block of obsidian (no obsidian within 10 blocks)
  # Recommendation is to keep this true so that newbies don't bother you or reset their
  # island unnecessarily.
  allow-obsidian-scooping: true
  
  allow-teleport:
    # Allow /island teleport when falling. If set to false, all teleporting is
    # disabled until death from the void or until you hit something.
    # See commands that this will block too
    # Using "*" (with quotes) will block ALL commands when falling
    falling: true
    falling-blocked-commands:
    - home
    
    # The same as above, but this time it is when the player is swimming in acid
    acid: true
    acid-blocked-commands:
    - home

  # Time in seconds that players have to confirm sensitive commands, e.g. island reset
  confimation-time: 20
  
### World Settings ###
world:
  # Name of the world - if it does not exist then it will be generated.
  # It acts like a prefix for nether and end (e.g. BSkyBlock, BSkyBlock_nether, BSkyBlock_end)
  world-name: BSkyBlock_world

  # Radius of island in blocks. (So distance between islands is twice this)  
  # Will be rounded up to the nearest 16 blocks.
  # It is the same for every dimension : Overworld, Nether and End.
  # This value cannot be changed mid-game and the plugin will not start if it is different.
  distance-between-islands: 64

  # Default protection range radius in blocks. Cannot be larger than distance.
  # Admins can change protection sizes for players individually using /bsadmin setrange
  # or set this permission: bskyblock.island.range.<number>
  protection-range: 50

  # Start islands at these coordinates. This is where new islands will start in the
  # world. These must be a factor of your island distance, but the plugin will auto
  # calculate the closest location on the grid. Islands develop around this location
  # both positively and negatively in a square grid.
  # If none of this makes sense, leave it at 0,0.
  start-x: 0
  start-z: 0

  # Island height - Lowest is 5.
  # It is the y coordinate of the bedrock block in the schematic
  island-height: 120

  # Sea height (don't changes this mid-game unless you delete the world)
  # Minimum is 0, which means you are playing Skyblock!
  # If sea height is less than about 10, then players will drop right through it
  # if it exists. Makes for an interesting variation on skyblock.
  sea-height: 0

  # Maximum number of islands in the world. Set to 0 for unlimited. 
  # If the number of islands is greater than this number, no new island will be created.
  max-islands: 0

  ### Nether-related Settings ###
  nether:
    # Generate Nether - if this is false, the nether world will not be made and access to
    # the nether will not occur. Other plugins may still enable portal usage.
    # Note: Some challenges will not be possible if there is no nether.
    # Note that with a standard nether all players arrive at the same portal and entering a
    # portal will return them back to their islands.
    generate: true

    # Islands in Nether. Change to false for standard vanilla nether.
    islands: true

    # Nether trees are made if a player grows a tree in the nether (gravel and glowstone)
    # Applies to both vanilla and islands Nether
    trees: true

    # Make the nether roof, if false, there is nothing up there
    # Change to false if lag is a problem from the generation
    # Only applies to islands Nether
    roof: true
   
    # Nether spawn protection radius - this is the distance around the nether spawn
    # that will be protected from player interaction (breaking blocks, pouring lava etc.)
    # Minimum is 0 (not recommended), maximum is 100. Default is 25.
    # Only applies to vanilla nether
    spawn-radius: 25
  
  end:
    generate: true
    islands: true
    
  ### Entities-related Settings ###
  entities:
    # Sets the limit for number of entities that can spawn in a chunk in this world.
    # Note: this does not limit the number of them, just how many spawn naturally.
    # Note: If set to a negative number the world will use the server-wide spawn limit instead.
    spawn-per-chunk:
      # Limit monsters spawn
      monsters: 100
      # Limits animals spawn
      animals: 15
      # Limits water animals (Squid) spawn
      water-animals: 15

    # General entity limiting
    # Use this section to limit how many entities can be added to an island.
    # 0 means the item will be blocked from placement completely.
    # Uncomment to set the limit. The numbers are just suggested values.
    # The limit is per-world, so a hopper limit of 30 means up to 30 in the overworld and
    # up to 30 in the nether.
