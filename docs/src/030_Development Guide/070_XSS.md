To prevent Xss attacks through unsafe content, 
AEM provides the XssApi. The usage of the XssApi depends on 
the context of the content rendering, whether it is rendered into an attribute, 
an inline script or a text node. In React we don't need to worry 
about attributes and don't use inline scripts. The developer only needs to be careful when rendering content into a text node.

The mode __unsafe__ does not change the text and will for example also output script tags as is.
The mode __html__ uses `XssApi.filterHTML` and will remove script tags and more according to the AntiSamy rules configured in AEM.
The mode __text__ escapes all tags.

# Usage

There is a special component `Text` which escapes text and renders it into a container.

````tsx 

render() {
  return (<Text value={this.props.richText} element="div" context="html"/>
}

````

This component has another benefit. The possibly long text will not be inserted into the Cache but an id instead. Hence the html sent to the client is shorter.
