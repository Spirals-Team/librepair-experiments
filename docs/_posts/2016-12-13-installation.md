## Dependencies 
BBoxDB depends on the following programs:

- Java (>= 8, Oracle)
- Git
- Maven

On Ubuntu, you can install them by typing:

```bash
apt-get install oracle-java8-installer ant maven git
```

On Debian, you can install them by typing:

```bash
apt-get install java-package ant maven git

# Download the JDK from Oracle, replace $version with the current version of the JVM
make-jpkg jdk-$version-linux-x64.tar.gz
dpkg -i oracle-java8-jdk_$version_amd64.deb
```

_Notice:_ You could also use OpenJDK, but we are recommending the Oracle JVM. BBoxDB uses memory mapped files, features such as cleaning allocated memory is not available in all JVMs. Also, we recommend using a 64-bit operating system. Due to the memory mapped files, BBoxDB needs a huge virtual address space. 32-bit systems can address up to 4 GB memory, which makes it hard to handle big datasets.

_Notice:_ BBoxDB should run on every Linux distribution, but at the moment the software is only tested on Debian and Ubuntu Linux.

### Clock synchronization
BBoxDB uses timestamps to order operations. So, it is useful to have a reliable time source on all systems. We strongly recommend to synchronize the local clock with an NTP server. You can accomplish this by executing:

```bash
apt-get install ntp
``` 

## Setup the environment
Let the environment variable BBOXDB_HOME point to the installation directory. For example ```/opt/bboxdb```:

```bash
export BBOXDB_HOME=/opt/bboxdb
echo 'export BBOXDB_HOME=/opt/bboxdb' >> .bashrc
```

## Downloading and compiling the software
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jnidzwetzki/bboxdb
mv bboxdb $BBOXDB_HOME
$BBOXDB_HOME/bin/manage_instance.sh bboxdb_update
```

The last command executes maven, downloads all needed dependencies and complies BBoxDB. This step has to be repeated on every node in your cluster.

# Initial Setup
The following sections are covering the initial setup of the BBoxDB.

## Setup the nodes of the system
BBoxDB employs [Apache Zookeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) to coordinate the distributed system. BBoxDB includes some helper scripts to install and configure the Zookeeper installation automatically. To setup the Zookeeper and BBoxDB nodes, you only need to define the name of the hosts in two files. The file ```$BBOXDB_HOME/conf/bboxdb-nodes``` contains the name of all BBoxDB nodes and the file ```$BBOXDB_HOME/conf/zookeeper-nodes``` contains the names of all Zookeeper nodes. It is recommended to define at least 3 Zookeeper nodes. Bellow, you find an example with 3 Zookeeper nodes and 6 BBoxDB nodes. Zookeeper and BBoxDB can be installed on the same hardware.

```bash
cat $BBOXDB_HOME/conf/zookeeper-nodes
node1
node2
node3

cat $BBOXDB_HOME/conf/bboxdb-nodes
node1
node2
node3
node4
node5
node6
```

## Ports and JVM parameter
The file `$BBOXDB_HOME/bin/bboxdb-env.sh` contains the configuration options for the BBoxDB service and the JVM parameter. You should open the file and adjust the settings to your preferences. 

__Notice:__ At least, the parameter `jmx_password` should be customized. Otherwise, unauthorized attackers could connect to the JMX interface of the JVM and perform operations like a shutdown of the BBoxDB.

```bash
vi $BBOXDB_HOME/bin/bboxdb-env.sh
```

## Starting and stopping the system
To manage the processes of BBoxDB, two scripts are provided: ```$BBOXDB_HOME/bin/manage_instance.sh``` is used to start and stop the processes on the local node. ```$BBOXDB_HOME/bin/manage_cluster.sh``` is used to managed a whole cluster of nodes.

Both scripts require one parameter. This parameter determines the operation of the script. Depending on the script, the task is performed only on the local system or on the whole cluster.

|    Parameter       |                Description                |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| zookeeper_start    | Configure and start zookeeper             |
| zookeeper_stop     | Stop zookeeper                            |
| zookeeper_drop     | Stop zookeeper and drop the stored data   |
| zookeeper_client   | Connect to the local zookeeper process and open an interactive shell. _This parameter is only available with the manage_instance.sh script_  |
| bboxdb_start       | Start the BBoxDB process                  | 
| bboxdb_start_debug | Start the BBoxDB process in debug mode    | 
| bboxdb_start_trace | Start the BBoxDB process  in trace mode   | 
| bboxdb_stop        | Stop the BBoxDB process                   |
| bboxdb_upgrade     | Download the last version from github and compile the source |

__Example:__ Start a whole cluster:

```bash
$BBOXDB_HOME/bin/manage_cluster.sh zookeeper_start
$BBOXDB_HOME/bin/manage_cluster.sh bboxdb_start
```

__Example:__ Stop a whole cluster:


```bash
$BBOXDB_HOME/bin/manage_cluster.sh bboxdb_stop
$BBOXDB_HOME/bin/manage_cluster.sh zookeeper_stop
```

## Logfiles
Zookeeper and BBoxDB messages are written into logfiles. Depending on the start parameter of the server ```bboxdb_start```, ```bboxdb_start_debug``` or ```bboxdb_start_trace```, a different amount of details are written into the log files.

|    Logfile                  |            Content                |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| $BBOXDB_HOME/zookeeper.log  | Details about the operation of Zookeeper     |
| $BBOXDB_HOME/bboxdb.log     | Details about the operation of BBoxDB        |
