**Table:** A set of tuples.

**Distribution Group:** All tables of a distribution group are distributed in the same manner.

**Distribution Directory:** This mapping is stored in Zookeeper and determines which node is responsible for which area.

**Distribution Region:** A subspace in an n-dimensional space. 

**Tuple store:** Stores a set of tuples. The data of one table of one distribution region is stored in a tuple store. The tuple store stores the data in Memtables and in SSTables.

**Tuple store configuration:** The configuration of a tuple store. Among other things, this configuration defines whether the tuple store allows duplicates or not.
