FluentLenium is a website automation framework which extends Selenium to write reliable and resilient UI functional tests. 

This framework is React ready. Written and maintained by people who are automating browser-based tests on a daily basis.

Written in Java, provides [fluent interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface) to
[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) and brings some magic to avoid common issues faced by Selenium users.

It's shipped with adapters for [JUnit](junit.org/), [TestNG](http://testng.org/doc/index.html), 
[Cucumber](https://cucumber.io) and the [Spock](http://spockframework.org/) as well. It may be used standalone too.

FluentLenium integrates the best with [AssertJ](http://joel-costigliola.github.io/assertj/), but you can also choose
different assertion library if you want.
