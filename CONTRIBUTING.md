# Contributing to this library

LightCouch is written in Java and uses [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as its build tool.

## Requirements

The main requirements are:

* Java 1.6
* CouchDB

## Coding guidelines

Adopting the [Google Java Style](https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html)
with the following changes:

```
4.2
    Our block indent is +4 characters

4.4
    Our line length is 100 characters.

4.5.2
    Indent continuation of +4 characters fine, but I think
    IDEA defaults to 8, which is okay too.
```
