## How to help ?

Feel free to contribute to Kraken ! There are two easy ways of helping me:

- submit an issue containing your ideas ;
- create a pull request.

## Bug report

Bug report are done with issues. Please be careful to respect those few points:

- check if the bug hasn't be reported yet ;
- indicate the version of Kraken you use ;
- describe your problem as best as possible. If you can post a minimal code that triggers the bug, it will be much easier for me ;
- attach any relevant file.
