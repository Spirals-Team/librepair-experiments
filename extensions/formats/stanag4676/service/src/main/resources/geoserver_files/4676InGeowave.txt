How we use 4676 in Geowave
1. CQL FILTER on time. 
	For example,
	   CQL_FILTER=(StartTime>=yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ AND StartTime<=yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ)
2. GetFeatureInfo with feature attributes to include the image and video chips.
	See example content.ftl files included with this file. Content.ftl files should be installed in 
		$GEOSERVER_HOME/data_dir/workspaces/<workspace_name>/<store_name>/<layer_name>
	When preview layers in geoserver via the OpenLayers option, if you click on an item, you should see 
	the clicked feature's details listed and not in a table. With the track_points and motion_points, an
	image should be displayed. With the tracks, a looping video of the tracked item should be shown.
3. Styles in Geoserver that use decimation.
	See example style files included with this file.
	Motion Points should be displayed (and decimated based on zoom level) using the icons that are in the icons subfolder.
	Tracks should be colored based on speed.
	Track points should be colored based on speed (and decimated based on zoom level).
4. KDE generation - density maps.
