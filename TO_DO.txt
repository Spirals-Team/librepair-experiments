Bugs
~~~~


Fixed bugs
~~~~~~~~~~
1. Why are users intermittently shown as logged out on client side? Seems this only happens on "auto admin" first use. User needs to log off and log back on again before using.
2. Why is the /books api called twice when going into the detail of a book.
3. Fix correct selection of book rating when going back in to edit a book.
4. The search by reviewer input box isnt properly re-initialised after use
5. Make sure that the count by rating is ordered by rating value desc (not count desc)
6. Auto admin functionality requires a user to log in twice before it works
7. Why arent the "theme" font files picked up in the production build of the client project?
8. Mobile (small) view - logon problems. Facebook not working? Not displaying logged on user details?
9. Fix summary table and comments grid layout on small mobiles
