<body>
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>This lookup service has the following optional lookup coordinate keys:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>request.method; defaults to 'get', valid values:
            <ul>
                <li>delete</li>
                <li>get</li>
                <li>post</li>
                <li>put</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>body; contains a string representing JSON, XML, etc. to be sent with any
            of those methods except for "get".</li>
        <li>mime.type; specifies media type of the request body, required when 'body' is passed.</li>
        <li>*; any other keys can be configured to pass variables to resolve target URLs. See 'Dynamic URLs' section below.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The record reader is used to consume the response of the REST service call and turn it into one or more records. The record path property
    is provided to allow for a lookup path to either a nested record or a single point deep in the REST response. Note: a valid schema must be
    built that encapsulates the REST response accurately in order for this service to work.</p>
    <h2>Headers</h2>
    <p>Headers are supported using dynamic properties. Just add a dynamic property and the name will be the header name and the value will be the value for the header. Expression language
    powered by input from the variable registry is supported.</p>
    <h2>Dynamic URLs</h2>
    <p>The URL property supports expression language through the lookup key/value pairs configured on the processor. The configuration specified by the user will be passed
    through to the expression language engine for evaluation. Note: flowfile attributes and variable registry settings will be disregarded here for this property.</p>
    <p>Ex. URL: <em>http://example.com/service/${user.name}/friend/${friend.id}</em>, combined with example record paths:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>user.name => "/example/username"</li>
        <li>friend.id => "/example/first_friend"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Would dynamically produce an endpoint of <em>http://example.com/service/john.smith/friend/12345</em></p>

    <h3>Environment specific URLs</h3>

    <p>If target URL has environment specific part, such as server name and port,
        then 'Base URL' property can be used to resolve it by an expression language with variable registry.
        This way, the consistent lookup coordinate keys can be used in different environments.</p>
    <p>Ex. Base URL: <em>http://${apiServerHostname}:${apiServerPort}</em>, combined with example variable registry:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>apiServerHostname => "test.example.com"</li>
        <li>apiServerPort => "8080"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ex. URL: <em>/service/${user.name}/friend/${friend.id}</em>, combined with the previous example record paths</p>
    <p>Would dynamically produce an endpoint of <em>http://test.example.com:8080/service/john.smith/friend/12345</em></p>
