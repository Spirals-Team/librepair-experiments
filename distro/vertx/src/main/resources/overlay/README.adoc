Marc Savy <marc@rhymewithgravy.com>

IMPORTANT: Please refer to the apiman documentation and config annotations for detailed configuration instructions.

== Launching

```
./apiman-gateway.sh --conf=configs/<your-conf.json>
```

== Logging

By default the apiman Vert.x gateway uses log4j2 with an asynchronous logging configuration.
Modify `log4j2.xml` to tailor logging config.

== Interactive Debugging

Provide the `--debug` flag to enable https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/introclientissues005.html[interactive debugging].
You can attach your debugger on port `8787` or set `DEBUG_PORT` to customise the port.
Refer to OpenJDK's documentation for more detailed information. 

== Additional JVM Options

For providing additional JVM options (such as increasing heap size), you can use either `APIMAN_GATEWAY_OPTS` or `JAVA_OPTS`, both of which will be included.
For example:

```bash
export APIMAN_GATEWAY_OPTS="-Xmx2g"
```
