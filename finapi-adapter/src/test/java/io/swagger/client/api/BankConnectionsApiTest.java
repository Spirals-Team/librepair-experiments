     * Import a new bank connection
     *
     * Imports a new bank connection for a specific user. Must pass the connection credentials and the user&#39;s access_token. All bank accounts will be downloaded and imported with their current balances, transactions and supported two-step procedures (note that the amount of available transactions may vary between banks, e.g. some banks deliver all transactions from the past year, others only deliver the transactions from the past three months). The balance and transactions download process runs asynchronously, so this service may return before all balances and transactions have been imported. Also, all downloaded transactions will be categorized by a separate background process that runs asynchronously too. To check the status of the balance and transactions download process as well as the background categorization process, see the status flags that are returned by the GET /bankConnections/&lt;id&gt; service.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note that some banks may require a multi-step authentication, in which case the service will respond with HTTP code 510 and an error message containing a challenge for the user from the bank. You must display the challenge message to the user, and then retry the service call, passing the user&#39;s answer to the bank&#39;s challenge in the &#39;challengeResponse&#39; field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can also import a \&quot;demo connection\&quot; which contains a single bank account with some pre-defined transactions. To import the demo connection, you need to pass the identifier of the \&quot;demo bank\&quot;, which is a bank with BLZ 00000000 (see GET /banks/search). In case of demo connection import, any other fields besides the demo bank identifier can remain unset. The bankingUserId, bankingPin, and storePin fields will be stored, however they will generally not be relevant when updating the bank connection. Also, the skipPositionsDownload flag is ignored for the demo bank connection, i.e. when importing the demo bank connection, you will always get the transactions for its account. You can enable multi-step authentication for the demo bank connection by setting the bank connection name to \&quot;MSA\&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For a more in-depth understanding of the import process, please also read this article on our Dev Portal: &lt;a href&#x3D;&#39;https://finapi.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000296607-Import-Update-of-Bank-Connections-Accounts&#39;&gt;Import &amp; Update of Bank Connections / Accounts&lt;/a&gt;
