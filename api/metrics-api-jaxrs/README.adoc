== Starting a development container

Assuming you have a Cassandra node running on localhost,
you can simply run the following command in the module directory:

[source,bash]
----
mvn wildfly:run
----

You can also setup your IDE for starting a Wildfly container and deploying the WAR file. It's very easy and well
documented for both Eclipse and IntelliJ.
