 * Annotation used to specify that a section that would otherwise be inherited

 * Annotations for help sections are automatically inherited down the class
 * hierarchy which allows for a parent class to define a common help section
 * (e.g. {@link ExitCodes}). This can be overridden by specifying it again
 * further down the class hierarchy but in some cases it may actually be
 * desirable to hide an inherited section entirely in which case this annotation
 * may be used.
