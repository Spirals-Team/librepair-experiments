# Debugging Knot.x Demo

## Requirements

To run Knot.x you only need Java 8.
To build it you also need Maven (version 3.3.1 or higher).
Intellij IDE

## How to set up Knot.x debugging in Intellij IDE
Assuming you have Knot.x project opened in Intellij, you can set up Run/Debug Application configuration to be able to run or debug Demo or 
Standalone Knot.x application directly in your IDE.

1. Go to Run/Debug Configurations in IntelliJ
2. Add new Application Configuration

3. Set name of the configuration
4. Pick main class to be io.knotx.launcher.KnotxLauncher
5. In Program Arguments specify that KnotxStarterVerticle should be run with the `-conf` parameter pointing to the configuration you want to run (e.g. Example app)
```
run io.knotx.launcher.KnotxStarterVerticle -conf src/main/resources/knotx-example-app.json
```
6. Set **Working directory** to the module where your json config exists (e.g. knotx-example-app)
7. Set **Use classpath of module** by selecting the module in which you have your configuration (e.g. knotx-example-app)
8. Optionally, in VM options you can specify system properties if you want to override configuration or set memory properly of this configuration.
9. Finally, you can now Run or Debug this configuration and play with Knot.x as usuall.

## How to debug remote instance of Knot.x 
Assuming you have running Knot.x on dedicated machine (not localhost) and you'd like to debug it. All you have to do is just add JVM properties to enable it.

E.g.:
```
-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=n,address=5005
```

Then, you can connect to that instance (machine IP) on the port specified in the properties above.
