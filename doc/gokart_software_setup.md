## BASLER ACE acA2500-60uc color camera setup

* Verify that the LED on the back of the Basler camera is green.

Open a terminal (Ctrl+Alt+T) and run the following commands in order to source your catkin workspace, and launch the color camera node that publishes images acquired from the basler ace acA2500-60uc camera run:
    
    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch pylon_camera color_camera_node.launch

Remark: When you are finished with the operation, press Ctrl+C in order to terminate the image acquisition.

In order to record the camera images for post processing, in a new terminal issue
    
    rosbag record color_camera_node/image_raw/compressed

To inspect the camera image for instance for focus and calibration, you can type:

    rosrun image_view image_view image:=/color_camera_node/image_raw

## BASLER ACE acA640-750um grayscale camera setup

* Verify that the LED on the back of the Basler camera is green.

To publish images from the basler ace acA640-750um camera you will have to open another terminal, and execute:

    source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
    roslaunch pylon_camera BW_camera_node.launch

Remark: When you are finished with the operation, press Ctrl+C in order to terminate the image acquisition.

The data is logged in the rosbag format by issuing

    rosbag record BW_camera_node/image_raw/compressed

To inspect the camera image for instance for focus and calibration, you can type:

    rosrun image_view image_view image:=/BW_camera_node/image_raw

> Alternative logging method: If you have no idea what rosbags are, you can just run the script which will log stuff automatically for you (in new terminal).

    source ~/catin_ws/src/pylon_camera/scripts/log_camera_topics.bash
    
> This script will log messages from all the cameras that are connected to the USB hub. You can stop it using (Ctrl+C).
