MBStyle reference
=================

This section will detail the usage and syntax of the MBStyle language.

As MBstyle is heavily modeled on `JSON <http://json.org>`_, it may be useful to refer to the `JSON-Schema documentation <http://json-schema.org/documentation.html>`_ for basic syntax.

For an extended reference to these styles check out the `Mapbox Style Specifications <https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/style-spec/>`_.
