/**
 * Used to simulate an exception. Commonly used to avoid throwing something like
 * {@link IllegalStateException} or {@link IllegalArgumentException} in tests (catching those could
 * mask other errors if the message on the exception isn't verified, and asserting that message
 * would only cause further confusion as that's not really what the test is about). Catching
 * {@link SimulatedException} should be safe in tests as that's the purpose of the test, to catch it
 * and verify behavior when it occurs. <br>
 * <b>Reminder:</b> don't forget to call {@link Fail#fail(String) fail} if the exception doesn't
 * happen (otherwise you won't notice any test failures and a kitten may die)
