# Multibanking Webapplication
## Introduction
This is a starter template for [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/docs/) projects. Its purpose is to show users the functionality of the multibanking project. You can e.g. add your real bank accesses, choose your bank accounts and display bookings. You can furthermore decide weather you want your raw bookings or prepared transaction data.

## How to use this template

*This template does not work on its own*. The shared files for each starter are found in the [ionic2-app-base repo](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

To use this template, either create a new ionic project using the ionic node.js utility, or copy the files from this repository into the [Starter App Base](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic2-app-base).

### With the Ionic CLI:

Take the name after `ionic2-starter-`, and that is the name of the template to be used when using the `ionic start` command below:

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic start myBlank blank
```

Then, to run it, cd into `myBlank` and run:

```bash
$ ionic cordova platform add ios
$ ionic cordova run ios
```

Substitute ios for android if not on a Mac.
