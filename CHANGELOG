pax-wicket-1.0.0 2012-03-28
--------------------------------------------

The 1.0.0 release is the first release with Wicket 5 (aka 1.5.x) support. It contains 5
bug-fixes identified during the 0.8.x line and some small improvements. Besides the
Wicket upgrade the 1.0.0 release also contains a Pax Exam (2.4.0) and Pax Logging (1.6.5)
upgrade. A small feature had been added to the test framework to workaround some of the
harder validation rules of Wicket 5. Besides of that the only things which require an
upgrade are related to the Wicket changes between Wicket 4 (aka 1.4.x) and Wicket 5
and not between Pax Wicket 0.8.x and 1.0.0.

pax-wicket-0.8.0 2012-02-06
--------------------------------------------

The 0.8.0 release is last (and final) feature release of the wicket 1.4.x series. All 
further bug-fixes and micro releases are done in micro release of the 0.8.x branch. 
The release fixes tons of bugs; upgrade to the latest wicket 1.4.x micro release (1.4.19);
upgrades the related dependencies (pax-web 1.0.8, karaf 2.2.5, slf4j 1.6.3, spring 3.0.7,
mockito 1.9.0, wiquery 1.2.4, ...); The most important features for the 0.8.x series are
a bundle-listener which decides automatically which bundles are to be included into an 
application making the registration of injection, mounting and class loading services no 
longer required; in addition the handling of injection handlers had been abstracted to be 
extendable now. Besides those direct API changes the entire documentation had been updated 
and completed. For almost every case an example had been added.
