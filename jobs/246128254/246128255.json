See https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/401.\n  Added the ability to set speeds for each nozzle tip changer movement. Defaults to 1.0, producing the same behavior as before.\n  Changed label of System output checkbox fixing capitalization and removing superfluous \"enable\" word. Refactored code a bit to make it compatible with WindowBuilder.\n  Changes suggested by @vonnieda to SystemLogger simplifying the print mechanics\n  remove unnecessary out reference in System Logger\n  Fix the double line breaks from the script runners Fix the StackOverflow on shutdown where Logger gets called but is no longer available (exception loop)\n  Reverted ReferenceBottomVision.java to upstream/develop\n  Removed previousStage, currentStage and alias `..`, as @cri-s getWorkingModel() implements their intended functionality.\n  Added @cri-s getWorkingModel()\n  Added currentStage, previousStage to CvPipeline. Added special stage name '..' to mean 'previousStage' for convenience.",
