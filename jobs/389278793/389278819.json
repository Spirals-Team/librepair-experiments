    "message": "fix: configure benchmark forks to greater than zero\n\nBenchmarks configured with zero forks are prone to profile-guided optimization from JVM and other\neffects that offsets the measurement considerably.\nJMH strongly warns against using zero forks, and without the '-f' option being specified in the command line\njmh will run every bench in the same VM, using optimizations guided from the first benchmarks and artificially\nspeeding-up later ones.\n\nWe run the benchmarks 10 times with same number of iterations and warmups, and we observe:\n- effects were not as high as AddingPaddingZeros bench, highest factor of difference ~1.50\n\n- Class: BindingBooleans\n- Mode: Average time\n- Unit: ns/op\n- Score reported as median\n- Every comparison had significant diference (Moore median's test)\nMethod\t        Factor\tFixed\tOriginal\nbindBoolean\t1.49    7.985\t5.35\nboolAsBoolean\t1.09    10.915\t9.965\nboolAsInt\t1.17    14.931\t12.665\n\nIt might still be important to keep the configuration of fork = 1 in case more benchmarks are added/modified\nin the BindBoolena class.",
