    "message": "NIFI-4772: Refactored how the @OnScheduled methods of processors is invoked/monitored. The new method does away with the two previously created 8-thread thread pools and just uses the Timer-Driven thread pool that is used by other framework tasks.\n\nNIFI-4772: Introduced a new thread-pool with 2 threads that will be used for monitoring lifecycle task. This means that if all threads in the timer-driven thead pool are blocked by processors that don't complete their @OnScheduled methods, we have a separate thread pool that at least gives us a chance of interrupting those threads\n\nNIFI-4772: Remove unused import\nSigned-off-by: Matthew Burgess <mattyb149@apache.org>\n\nThis closes #2403",
