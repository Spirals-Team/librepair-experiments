This was done in a backward\ncompatible way where server side could handle both split as well as\nunsplit strings.\n\nThis optimization was off-by default and was enabled with a config.\nNow that the changes have been around for several months, this PR cleans\nup the config and enables the change by default.\n\nThe server-side is still backward compatible with old broker. This can\nbe cleaned up future PR once broker changes have been around for a\nwhile.",
