    "message": "Changing mappings to use CacheLoader, PR review fixes\n\nBased on the pull request review, making some major changes. List of\nchanges:\n* Handling mapping schema names now as well as table names\n* Using CacheLoader to handle loading/adding/reloading the name mapping\n  for both schema and tables\n* Needed to change so that the concrete client can return the raw\n  schema/table names from protected methods, which the base class then\n  lowercases as needed\n* Needed to have a way to prevent initial cache loading for the Plugin\n  tests for each of the clients, otherwise it would fail as no server\n  was created to load schemas/tables from\n* Updated the Plugin tests for each JDBC concrete client to set the flag\n  to not auto-load the schema/table mappings\n* Test checking the mapping and case sensitivity is in the presto-mysql\n  plugin, as the issues with H2 for a case-sensitive mean I need MySQL\n  instance to test against, which means the MySqlClient, which I can't\n  pull into presto-base-jdbc as it would cause a circular dependancy",
