    "message": "Fix syntax and snippet generator in Pipeline\n\nThe previous approach was...odd. The result was that the snippet\ngenerator would fail badly, and there were a lot of \"required\"\nparameters that were not, in fact, required. So I reworked things to\nmake the non-required parameters not on the @DataBoundConstructors,\nadded @DataBoundSetter methods where appropriate, added the additional\n\"bzt\" and \"perfReport\" symbols for compatibility purposes, added real\ntests for the steps, and bumped a lot of dependencies to modern\nversions, etc.\n\nThis does *not* fix the durability problem - PerformancePublisher\nisn't a DurableTask, and so if it's running while the Jenkins master\nrestarts or otherwise gets disconnected from the agent, the build will\nfail. With a DurableTask, such as \"sh\" or \"bat\", the task will keep\nrunning even if the master gets disconnected, and the build will pick\nback up upon reconnecting.",
