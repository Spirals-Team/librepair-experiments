    "message": "Improved matching of generics in AnnotationHandlerBeanPostProcessors\n\nWhen a class would declare both `@CommandHandler` and `@QueryHandler`\nannotated method, it would be proxied twice with only generics as the\nmain difference. This improvement ensures that the proxies method will\ncall the correct adapter, taking generics into account as well. It does\nso by attempting to find a non-synthetic and non-abstract method with\nparameters matching the invocation. If such method is found, the\ncorresponding adapter is invoked.\n\nResolves #670",
