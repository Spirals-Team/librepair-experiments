    "message": "TiffWriter: Don't split planes when using nonstandard SamplesPerPixel\n\nThe existing behaviour seems rather ad-hoc and potentially\ndangerous.\n\n- We ignore the SPP the user specified and write out something\n  completely different, silently\n- ChannelSeparator and bfconvert already provide the means to\n  do this explicitly and intentionally\n- While the aim of this appears to be as an aid toward greater\n  interoperability with other software, it prevents the user\n  writing out e.g. images with 2 or 4 samples per pixel.  If\n  the user is writing out an OME-TIFF, the TiffData elements\n  won't be able to represent the altered structure (the\n  separated planes), and the file will not be readable as an\n  OME-TIFF because the OME-XML metadata will not match the\n  TIFF SamplesPerPixel\n\nThis logic also breaks a loop in the writer:\n  saveBytes → prepareToWriteImage → saveBytes\nCombined with tiling, this could result in calling saveBytes with\nthe wrong series index.  This removal makes the code easier to\nunderstand, and removes some dangerous assumptions to make it\nsafer.\n\nThe default PhotometricInterpretation is adjusted to be correct\nwith the special case removed.",
