    "message": "Fix four bugs with numeric dimension output types. (#6220)\n\n* Fix four bugs with numeric dimension output types.\n\nThis patch includes the following bug fixes:\n\n- TopNColumnSelectorStrategyFactory: Cast dimension values to the output type\n  during dimExtractionScanAndAggregate instead of updateDimExtractionResults.\n  This fixes a bug where, for example, grouping on doubles-cast-to-longs would\n  fail to merge two doubles that should have been combined into the same long value.\n- TopNQueryEngine: Use DimExtractionTopNAlgorithm when treating string columns\n  as numeric dimensions. This fixes a similar bug: grouping on string-cast-to-long\n  would fail to merge two strings that should have been combined.\n- GroupByQuery: Cast numeric types to the expected output type before comparing them\n  in compareDimsForLimitPushDown. This fixes #6123.\n- GroupByQueryQueryToolChest: Convert Jackson-deserialized dimension values into\n  the proper output type. This fixes an inconsistency between results that came\n  from cache vs. not-cache: for example, Jackson sometimes deserializes integers\n  as Integers and sometimes as Longs.\n\nAnd the following code-cleanup changes, related to the fixes above:\n\n- DimensionHandlerUtils: Introduce convertObjectToType, compareObjectsAsType,\n  and converterFromTypeToType to make it easier to handle casting operations.\n- TopN in general: Rename various \"dimName\" variables to \"dimValue\" where they\n  actually represent dimension values. The old names were confusing.\n\n* Remove unused imports.",
