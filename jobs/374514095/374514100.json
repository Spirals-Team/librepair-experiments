(#5735)\n\nThe \"lock\" object was used to synchronize start/stop as well as synchronize removals\r\nfrom segmentsToDelete (when a segment is done dropping). This could cause a deadlock\r\nif a segment-load throws an exception during loadLocalCache. loadLocalCache is run\r\nby start() while it holds the lock, but then it spawns loading threads, and those\r\nthreads will try to acquire the \"segmentsToDelete\" lock if they want to drop a corrupt\r\nsegments.\r\n\r\nI don't see any reason for these two locks to be the same lock, so I split them.",
