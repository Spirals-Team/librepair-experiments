(No need to use same size interval size with other\nworkers.)  A worker consults the unknown map and adds an\ninterval to the working map.  When the quorum repair scan\nis complete, a worker removes the interval from working\nand adds it to healthy.\n\nIntervals that sit in the working map for too long are\nconsidered failed and re-eligible to be scanned.  A reliable\ndetector of worker faults isn't needed: duplicate scans can't\ndamage Corfu data.",
