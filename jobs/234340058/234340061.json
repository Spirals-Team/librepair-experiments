    "message": "simplify DefaultDockerClientUnitTest\n\nrefactor this test to use a MockWebServer rather than mocking the\nJersey/jax-rs Client interface used by the DefaultDockerClient.\n\nUsing a (Mockito) mock Client is problematic for a test since it has\nsuch a rich and fluent interface - the test needs to know exactly which\nmethods are called on the Client.\n\nUltimately, this is not what a unit test of DefaultDockerClient should\ncare about - a good test would only care about what HTTP requests it\nsends to the Docker Remote API and how it behaves when it gets certain\nHTTP responses back.\n\nThe MockWebServer allows us to control the HTTP responses and capture\nthe HTTP requests much easier than using a Mockito mock of the\nparticular HTTP client library used by DefaultDockerClient.\n\nWith this approach, it would be possible to one day change\nDefaultDockerClient to use a different HTTP client library without\nhaving to change one line of this test. The same cannot be said of using\nMockito.\n\nThis change was initially driven by a desire to make PR #749 easier to\ntest, to check that it sends expected authentication headers, but I\nthink it will be useful and help improve testing in docker-client across\nthe board.\n\nhttps://github.com/square/okhttp/tree/master/mockwebserver",
