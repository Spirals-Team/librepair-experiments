    "message": "Cleanup: Enable splitting of in-clause strings by default.\n\nPR's #1819 and #2188 enabled optimization that avoids unnecessary\nsplit/join of strings in IN/NOT-IN clauses. This was done in a backward\ncompatible way where server side could handle both split as well as\nunsplit strings.\n\nThis optimization was off-by default and was enabled with a config.\nNow that the changes have been around for several months, this PR cleans\nup the config and enables the change by default.\n\nThis change does introduce a backward incompatibility with previous\nversion of broker, which can be mitigated as follows:\n1. Follow deployment order of controller -> broker -> server. OR\n2. If for some reason, newer server version needs to be deployed prior\nto the newer broker version, then set the following broker config:\npinot.broker.query.split.in.clause true",
