    "message": "[FLINK-9253][network] work around input gate buffer counts depending on known input channel types\n\nIf we don't know the channel type yet, i.e. there is an UnknownInputChannel, we\nwould use unused exclusive buffers for the floating buffer pool but as soon as\nan unknown channel is changed to a remote channel, we'd have to revoke those\nbuffers and use them as exclusive buffers. Since revoking buffers may be a\nblocking task, we go the other way around and reserve exclusive buffers for\nunknown input channels as well and either return them to the pool (for local\nchannels) or use them as exclusive buffers (for remote channels).\n\nTODO: some more tests for the added functionality",
