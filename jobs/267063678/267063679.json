Advanced orders will return in a month or two as\r\nsoon as we are better able to process them. We know that many of our clients like\r\nthe advanced orders, but they are used much less frequently than basic limit and\r\nmarket orders while taking more system resources to process.\r\n\r\n*The above changes will go into effect on Tuesday, August 22 around 6 am UTC (Monday\r\nAugust 21 around 11 pm Pacific).*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for choosing Kraken,\r\n\r\nThe Kraken Team",
