    "message": "Fix an issue in the JPA server if a resource has been previously saved containing vocabulary that is no longer valid. This only really  happened if you were using a non-final version of FHIR (e.g. using DSTU3 before it was finalized) but if you were in this situation, upgrading HAPI could cause you to have old codes that no longer exist in your database. This fix prevents these from blocking you from accesing those resources.",
