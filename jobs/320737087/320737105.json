    "message": "The current MultiHostChooser implementation in the following two scenarios is not very reasonable.\n\n1. jdbc:postgresql://slave1,master1/accounting?targetServerType=master\nEach time the cached host state expires(control by hostRecheckSeconds), need to try 2 times to connect to the correct server.\n\nimprovement：\nAdjust the connecting order, first try to connect master1\ncurrently: slave1 -> master1\nafter    : master1 -> slave1\n\n2. jdbc:postgresql://master1,slave1/accounting?targetServerType=preferSlave\nThe first connection or the first connection after cached host state expires, will be connected to the master1.\nBut that's not what we expected. Reasonable result is only in the absence of any available slave, will be connected to the Master.\n\nimprovement：\nWhen targetServerType is preferSlave, internal attempts to make connection twice.\nThe first time internally set targetServerType to 'slave' and connect. If the connecting fails, then set the targetServerType to 'any' and do a second attempt.",
