    "message": "[FLINK-9494] Fix race condition in Dispatcher with granting and revoking leadership\n\nThe race condition was caused by the fact that the job recovery is executed outside\nof the main thread. Only after the recovery finishes, the Dispatcher will set the new\nfencing token and start the recovered jobs. The problem arose if in between these two\noperations the Dispatcher gets its leadership revoked. Then it could happen that the\nDispatcher tries to run the recovered jobs even though it no longer holds the leadership.\n\nThe race condition is solved by checking first whether we still hold the leadership which\nis identified by the given leader session id.\n\nThis closes #6155.",
