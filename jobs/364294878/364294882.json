    "message": "Remove failure modes from segment status checker\n\nSimplified the logic for the segment status checker, removing some\npotential failure modes from the existing code:\n\n- Exceptions in the segment status check loop now only cause metrics for\n  that table to be unavailable, as opposed to bubbling out of the loop\n- Emit Long.MIN_VALUE instead of 0 for unavailable data\n- Remove flaky (and incorrect) logic that attempts to shut down and\n  restart the thread based on leadership change, it is far too brittle\n  for rather dubious performance gains\n\nMinor improvements to the code:\n\n- Emit a warning if the segment status checker is disabled, as opposed\n  to silently not starting the segment status checker\n- Rename segment status checker thread to \"Segment status checker\" from\n  \"SegStatChecker\"\n- Rename method \"runSegmentMetrics\" to \"updateSegmentMetrics\" to reflect\n  its actual purpose\n- Made \"updateSegmentMetrics\" package private as opposed to public\n- Remove some pointless comments",
