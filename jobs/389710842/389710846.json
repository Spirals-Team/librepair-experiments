    "message": "- Made HBaseColumn private, even though in the future, I would like to see something like a WideColumn interface to use for Wide Column stores.\n- Refactored the HBaseCreateTableBuilder so you don't have to pass the column families to the constructor, but it can determine them based on the columns set on it using the \"withColumn\" method.\n- Refactored the HBaseDeletionBuilder so it uses the \"whereItems\" instead of the custom \"setKey\" method to determine what rows it deletes.\n- Refactored the HBaseRowInsertionBuilder so it works with \"normal\" MetaModel columns and it will construct HBaseColumn for internal usage only.\n- Removed the no longer needed, not part of the interface createTable method from HBaseUpdateCallback\n- Move some test cases to a new HBaseClientTest class, because they specifically test the HBaseClient class\n- Updated some test in accordance with the refactorings mentioned above.",
