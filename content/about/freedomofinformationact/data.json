{"description":{"summary":"","keywords":[],"metaDescription":"","title":"Freedom of Information Act"},"markdown":["The Freedom of Information Act gives you the right to ask any public body for all the information they have on any subject you choose. \n\nUnless there’s a good reason, we will provide the information.\n\n###How to make a freedom of information request\n\nThe easiest way to make a request is to contact the Freedom of Information team at foi.team@ons.gov.uk after you have considered the following information:\n\n**Before making your request**\n\nWe already make a lot of information available to you. Before you request information from us, please try the three steps listed below. \n\nIf you still can't find what you are looking for, you can make a request under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\n- Search our website for the information\n- Check our publication scheme\n- Find out if we have already published the information \n\n**Making your request**\n\nWhen you send us your request please:\n\n**Be specific**\n\nYou will get the information faster if you help us identify the exact information you require. It will also mean that your request is less likely to be turned down on cost grounds. \n\nMake sure that you provide us with a narrow, tightly focused request and give, where appropriate, a relevant time-frame, for example, 1999 to 2000 or January to April 1985.\n\n**Let us know how you want the information**\n\nTell us how you would like the information provided to you, for example, by post or email, or let us know if would you prefer to come in to visit us to view it in person. We will try to meet your preference whenever we can.\n\n**Provide your contact details**\n\nThere may be occasions when we have to get in touch with you to discuss your request. It would therefore help if you could tell us how you would prefer us to contact you if we need to do so.\n\n**When we receive your request**\n\nWe aim to reply to you promptly and are obliged under the law to provide a response within 20 working days.\n\nSome information may not be available because it falls within one of the exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. When that happens, we will tell you which exemption applies and, in most cases, why the information cannot be released.\n\n**Who to send your request to**\n\nPlease email all requests to foi.team@ons.gov.uk\n\nor by post to:\n\nFOI team \nCB23 \nOffice for National Statistics \nSegensworth Road \nTitchfield \nPO15 5RR\n\n- [The ONS publication scheme](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/what-can-i-request/index.html) \n- [View our disclosure log of previous FOI requests](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/what-can-i-request/previous-foi-requests/index.html) \n\n**Access to your personal data**\n\nThe Data Protection Act 1998 gives you, as an individual, the right of access to your own personal data but also allows various exemptions to this right.\n\nWhere the personal data are only used for research purposes (such as the production of statistics), section 33 of the Act allows an exemption to this right of access. \n\nInformation we have collected about you is not used to make any decisions that would affect you as an individual, it is only used to produce statistics and in practice a lot of the data we collect is anonymised soon after we collect it. \n\nThis all means that once ONS has collected your data we are not obliged to tell you what data we hold about you. \n\nUnless we are obliged to do so by a court, we will normally refuse any request for personal information using this exemption.\n\nIf you wish to contact us about how we apply the Data Protection Act or if you believe you may still have a justification for finding out what information we hold about you, you can email us at: legalservices@ons.gov.uk\n\n[ONS Charging Policy](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/ons-charging-policy/index.html)\n\n**Review of the Thirty Year Rule**\n\nUnder the Public Records Act 1958, government departments are required to identify records worthy of permanent preservation and transfer them to The National Archives (TNA). In January 2013 the mandated time period for transfer will begin to reduce from 30 years to 20 years. Government departments and other public bodies will start transferring and releasing (subject to sensitivity considerations) an additional year’s worth of records every year for 10 years.\n\nThe ONS is committed to meeting the requirements of this change in legislation and has plans in place to do so.\n\nTNA have set up an ongoing reporting mechanism, the Record Transfer Report, to enable them to monitor departments' progress with the transition and compliance with the change. This will be reported annually to the Lord Chancellor.\n\nThe November 2014 Record Transfer Report for the ONS has been completed by the Records Management team in conjunction with their Information Management Consultant at TNA. It will form the baseline for the transition period.\n\nSome examples of ONS (or its predecessor departments) records selected by TNA in previous years include:\n\n- FV 63 - Ministry of Technology  relating to various utility and transport strikes in the 1970s\n- BT 70 - Board of Trade files relating to Balance of Payments and various trading topics for the UK\n- LAB 17 - Studies relating to various aspects of employment"],"type":"static_page","uri":"/about/freedomofinformationact","breadcrumb":[{"uri":"/"},{"uri":"/about"}],"links":[],"fileName":"freedomofinformationact"}
