Our work informs decisions that affect everyone in the UK, and we take our contribution to society seriously.\n\nWe know that excellent results can only be achieved by investing in and retaining the people who work for us. This is why our people count, in more ways than one.\n\nApart from crunching the numbers that shape big decisions in the UK, we also look after the interests of our people. We invest in training and development to enhance skills, and offer a good work-life balance to ensure well-being and staff retention. We have the figures to back that up: just 1% of our people left last year compared to a national average of 12.5%.\n\nWe want to create an environment where everyone is enthusiastic about helping us to succeed. You'll have opportunities to develop your skills, while working on things that affect the lives of millions. So, if you want your contribution to count and to work where you'll be really valued, come and join us."],"type":"static_page","uri":"/about/careersatons","breadcrumb":[{"uri":"/"},{"uri":"/about"}],"links":[{"uri":"","title":""}],"fileName":"careersatons"}
