Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n \nA [video][1] and an [infographic][2] explain how consumer price inflation is calculated.\n \nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to June 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between June 2014 and June 2015.\n \nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n \nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets. For more information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][1] (100.5 Kb Pdf).\n \n###Latest figure and long-term trend\n \nThe CPI 12-month rate (the amount prices change over a year) between June 2014 and June 2015 stood at 0.0%. This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in June 2014 would still have cost £100.00 in June 2015. This continues the trend of the previous 4 months when inflation had been at or around 0.0%.\n \nIn the year to June 2015, food prices fell by 2.2% and prices of motor fuels fell by 10.5%. These 2 groups, along with audio-visual and related equipment, have provided the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate in each month of 2015. In June 2015, the food and motor fuels groups in total reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.6 percentage points. Historically, price movements for these products have been among the main causes of inflation.

An alternative, and equally valid, approach is to calculate it by comparing the price change between the latest 2 months and the price change between the same 2 months a year ago. [Explaining the contribution to change in the 12-month rate][1] (37.1 Kb Pdf) is a diagram explaining the calculation.\n \nThe CPI was unchanged between May and June 2015 compared with a rise of 0.2% between the same 2 months a year earlier. The 1-month movement was therefore 0.2 percentage points lower this year compared with a year ago, resulting in a fall in the CPI 12-month rate. The difference between the movements in the annual and monthly rates is due to rounding.\n \nThe largest downward contributions to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between May and June 2015 came from:\n\n- **clothing and footwear:** prices, overall, fell by 0.4% between May and June this year compared with a rise of 0.6% between the same 2 months a year ago\n \n\tPrices usually fall between May and June as the summer sales begin but last year the average prices of a number of products rose. The main downward effect came from garments, particularly women’s outerwear.\n \n\n- **transport:** prices, overall, rose by 0.2% between May and June 2015 compared with a larger rise of 0.6% a year earlier\n \n\tThe downward contribution came from transport services (particularly air transport and, to a lesser extent, sea transport) where fares rose this year but by less than a year ago. This was partially offset by a small upward contribution from motor fuels with average petrol prices rising by 1.1 pence per litre between May and June this year compared with a smaller rise of 0.6 pence per litre a year earlier. Diesel prices also rose this year, by 0.5 pence per litre, compared with a fall of 0.4 pence per litre a year ago\n \n- **food and non-alcoholic beverages:** prices, overall, fell by 0.2% between May and June this year compared with a rise of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago.\n \n\tThe downward effect came from bread and cereals, and sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery.\n\nThere was a smaller downward contribution from price movements for health products.\n \nThe largest, but relatively small, upward contribution to the change in the CPI 12-month rate between May and June 2015 came from:\n\n- **miscellaneous goods and services:** prices, overall, rose by 0.2% between May and June 2015 compared with a fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago.

Full details can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website and in an explanatory note (313.9 Kb Pdf) on our website. The improvements from the resulting development work were introduced as part of the February 2015 dataset with the historical series revised back to 2005. Further information on the changes is available in 2 articles: Improvements to the measurement of Owner Occupiers’ Housing Costs and Private Housing Rental Prices (2.48 Mb Pdf) and Revising the weight of Owner Occupiers’ Housing in CPIH (197.4 Kb Pdf) .\n \nCPIH is a measure of UK consumer price inflation that includes owner occupiers’ housing costs (OOH). These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n \nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n \nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n \nIn June 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between June 2014 and June 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.3%, down from 0.4% in May 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in June 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in May, despite a small upward contribution from owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n \nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The full assessment report can be found on the UK Statistics Authority website.\n \nThe RPI is a long-standing measure of UK inflation that has historically been used for a wide range of purposes such as the indexation of pensions, rents and index-linked gilts. For further information see [Users and uses of consumer price inflation statistics][1] (100.5 Kb Pdf) .\n \nRPIJ is an improved variant of the Retail Prices Index, which is calculated using formulae that meet international standards. The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n \nIn June 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.4%, unchanged from May 2015.\n \nThe RPI 12-month rate for June 2015 stood at 1.0%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n \nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.7% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.7% as measured by RPIJ.

Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to March 2015. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the August CPI is published on 15 September 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to June 2015.\n \n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each Member State of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU Member States. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of June 2015 for EU Member States, together with an EU average, on 16 July 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables][10]. Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU Member States is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page][11].\n \n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation** \n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n \n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services][12] (139.4 Kb Pdf) . The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights][13] (431.9 Kb Pdf) .\n \n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables][14] (2.51 Mb Excel sheet) . By contrast, rates of change for the RPI and RPIJ are calculated from the published rounded indices.\n \n\tFurther information on the methods used to construct the CPI, CPIH, RPI and RPIJ, including differences in the methods used for each index can be found in the [Consumer Price Indices Technical Manual][15] (674.4 Kb Pdf).

The policy reaffirms the existing practices for CPI and RPI and sets out the policies for the new CPIH and RPIJ measures.\n \n\tIn summary, CPI, CPIH and RPIJ are revisable in theory though revisions only occur under exceptional circumstances. The RPI is never revised once published.\n \n5. **Publication policy** \n\n\tThis bulletin includes the June 2015 data, collected on and around 9 June 2015.
