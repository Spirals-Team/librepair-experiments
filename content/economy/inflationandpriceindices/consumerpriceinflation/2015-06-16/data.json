Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWIIzIw45Do \"video\") and an [infographic](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/infographics/how-cpi-is-calculated/index.html \"INFO CPI calculated\") explain how consumer price inflation is calculated.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to May 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between May 2014 and May 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets.

This means that a basket of goods and services that cost £100.00 in May 2014 would have cost £100.10 in May 2015. This continues the trend of the latest few months when inflation has been around 0.0%.\n\nIn the year to May 2015, food prices fell by 1.8% and prices of motor fuels fell by 11.0%. In both cases, the falls are smaller than in the year to April but along with audio-visual and related equipment they provided the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate for May. In total, the food and motor fuels groups reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.5 percentage points.

The majority of the upward contribution came from transport services, particularly air transport where fares rose this year but fell a year ago. Changes in fares between April and May vary notably year on year, with the timing of Easter a likely factor in the movements. There was also a significant upward effect from motor fuels with average petrol prices rising by 2.5 pence per litre between April and May this year compared with a smaller rise of 0.4 pence per litre a year earlier.

These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index.\n\nCPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn May 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between May 2014 and May 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.4%, up from 0.2% in April 2015. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in May 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in April, despite a small downward contribution from owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the official CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ\n\nIn May 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.4%, up from 0.3% in the year to April 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for May 2015 stood at 1.0%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 34.6% over the 10-year period, compared with 27.7% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 6.9 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.

Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. Previously the data published covered January 1996 to December 2014. The data for January to March 2015 are also now available. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the August CPI is published on 15 September 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to June 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each Member State of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU Member States. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of May 2015 for EU Member States, together with an EU average, on 17 June 2015.

Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-basket-of-goods-and-services/cpi-2015-basket-of-goods.pdf \"CPI 2015 Basket of Goods\") . The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi--updating-weights/2015.pdf \"2015\") .\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.49 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/may-2015/ref-table-cpi.xls \"REF table CPI\") .
