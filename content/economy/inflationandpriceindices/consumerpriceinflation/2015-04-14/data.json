Consumer price inflation is estimated by using price indices. A way to understand a price index is to think of a very large shopping basket containing all the goods and services bought by households. The price index estimates changes to the total cost of this basket. Consumer price indices are published monthly.\n\nA [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWIIzIw45Do \"Video\") and an [infographic](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/infographics/how-cpi-is-calculated/index.html \"INFO CPI calculated\") explain how consumer price inflation is calculated.\n\nA price index can be used to measure inflation in a number of ways. The most common is to look at how the index has changed over a year. This is calculated by comparing the price index for the latest month with the same month a year ago. This is known as the 12-month inflation rate. This bulletin measures inflation to March 2015, so the 12-month rate measures changes in prices between March 2014 and March 2015.\n\nA range of measures of consumer price and other price inflation are published.

First published in 1997 as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), the CPI is the inflation measure used in the Government’s target for inflation.\n\nThe CPI is also used for purposes such as uprating pensions, wages and benefits and can aid in the understanding of inflation on family budgets.

This is the joint lowest 12-month rate on record alongside the rate in February 2015.\n\nOver the last 5 years, the 3 main contributors to the 12-month inflation rate have been: transport (including motor fuels); housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; and restaurants and hotels. Combined, these 3 sectors have, on average, accounted for around half of the 12-month inflation rate.\n\nIn the year to March 2015, food prices fell by 3.2% and prices of motor fuels fell by 13.7%. In both cases, the falls were smaller than in the year to February but the 2 groups still provided the largest downward contributions to the 12-month rate for March. In total, the food and motor fuels groups reduced the CPI 12-month rate by approximately 0.8 percentage points. An article was published in November 2014 which outlined some [possible factors that may be affecting prices (477.2 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/what-is-affecting-prices-in-the-uk-in-2014-.pdf \"What is affecting prices in the UK in 2014?\") .\n\nFigure A shows the contributions to the CPI 12-month rate in March 2015 compared with the contributions to the 12-month rate a year earlier.

The 1-month movement was therefore the same in both years and this led to the CPI 12-month rate remaining at 0.0% for a second month.\n\nThe largest downward contributions to change in the CPI 12-month rate between February and March 2015 came from:\n\n- **clothing and footwear:** prices, overall, fell by 0.1% between February and March this year, compared with a rise of 1.8% between the same 2 months a year ago. This is the first time that prices have fallen between February and March since the CPI was introduced. Normally prices rise as they continue to recover following the January sales period. The downward contribution came from price movements for a range of women’s outerwear, particularly trousers, dresses and cardigans. There was also a smaller downward effect from men’s outerwear.\n\n- **housing and household services:** prices, overall, fell by 0.4% between February and March 2015 compared with a smaller fall of 0.1% between the same 2 months a year ago. The downward effect came from changes in gas prices, with average bills falling by more this year than a year ago.\n\n- **restaurants and hotels:** prices, overall, rose by 0.2% between February and March this year compared with a larger rise of 0.5% a year ago.\n\nThe largest upward contributions to change in the CPI 12-month rate between February and March 2015 came from:\n\n- **transport:** prices, overall, rose by 0.7% between February and March 2015 but were little changed between the same 2 months a year ago. The upward contribution came principally from motor fuels. Average petrol prices rose by 3.8 pence per litre between February and March this year compared with no change between the same 2 months a year ago. Diesel prices also rose this year by 3.5 pence per litre but fell by 0.4 pence per litre a year ago.\n\n- **food and non-alcoholic beverages:** prices, overall, fell by 0.2% between February and March 2015, compared with a larger fall of 0.5% between the same 2 months a year earlier. Small upward effects came from 4 product groups: milk, cheese and eggs; vegetables; sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery; and mineral waters, soft drinks and juices. These were partially offset by small downward contributions from meat and fruit.\n\nFigure C shows the contributions to change from each part of the CPI basket of goods and services.

These are the costs of housing services associated with owning, maintaining and living in one’s own home. OOH does not include costs such as utility bills, minor repairs and maintenance, which are already included in the index. CPIH uses an approach called rental equivalence to measure OOH. Rental equivalence uses the rent paid for an equivalent house as a proxy for the costs faced by an owner occupier. In other words this answers the question “how much would I have to pay in rent to live in a home like mine?” for an owner occupier. OOH does not seek to capture increases in house prices. Although this may be inconsistent with some users’ expectations of measures of OOH, the inclusion of an asset price and therefore capital gains would make the index less suitable for a measure of consumption. OOH currently accounts for 17.8% of the expenditure weight of CPIH. This compares with a weight of 19.5% in 2005.\n\nCurrently, the method of calculation, the population coverage and the basket of goods and services are the same as the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), with the exception of OOH. The method of deriving the weights for CPIH and the data used for these are also the same as for CPI, with the exception of OOH. This can result in some differences from the CPI.\n\nIn March 2015, the 12-month rate (the rate at which prices increased between March 2014 and March 2015) for CPIH stood at 0.3%, unchanged from February. The difference between the CPI and CPIH annual rates in March 2015 was 0.3 percentage points, the same as the difference in February, despite a small upward contribution from rising owner occupiers’ housing costs.\n\nFigure D shows the CPIH and OOH component 12-month rates since January 2006 (the earliest date for which the CPIH 12-month rate can be calculated). The CPI 12-month rate has been included for comparative purposes. Table B shows the CPIH and OOH component 1-month and 12-month rates and index values for the last year.

The rationale for creating RPIJ was to give users a better alternative to the RPI if their needs were for a measure of inflation based on the same population, classifications, weights, etc as the RPI. Currently, RPIJ also acts as an analytical series in that it allows users to see the impact of using the Jevons (which meets international standards) in place of the Carli formula (which does not meet international standards) in the RPI. The use of the different formulae at the elementary aggregate level is currently the only difference between the 2 indices. Detailed goods and services indices are not produced for RPIJ.\n\nIn March 2015, the 12-month rate for RPIJ stood at 0.3%, down from 0.4% in the year to February 2015.\n\nThe RPI 12-month rate for March 2015 stood at 0.9%, meaning that it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it would have been had it used formulae that meet international standards.\n\nFigure E shows the RPI and RPIJ 12-month rates for the last 10 years. Over this period, the RPIJ 12-month rate has been, on average, 0.5 percentage points lower than the RPI but the difference has increased to an average of 0.6 percentage points over the last 3 years. Cumulatively, inflation as measured by the RPI is 35.0% over the 10-year period, compared with 28.0% as measured by RPIJ. The use of the Carli formula has therefore added 7.0 percentage points to the change in prices over the last 10 years.

Please note, the data that are published are at a level which means that no individual retailer or service provider will be able to be identified. The data published covers January 1996 to December 2014. These data are updated once a quarter with around a 2-month lag with the latest CPI publication. For example, the data will next be updated when the May CPI is published on 16 June 2015, at which point the detailed data published will be extended to March 2015.\n\n\tInternationally, the CPI is known as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). HICPs are calculated in each Member State of the European Union according to rules specified in a series of European regulations developed by the European Commission (Eurostat) in conjunction with the EU member states. Eurostat releases figures for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for the month of March 2015 for EU member states, together with an EU average, on 17 April 2015. A summary of the latest European data is available from [Eurostat’s database tables](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/international/eurostat-s-data-tables.html \"Eurostat's Data Tables\"). Further information on HICP for the European Union, Euro area and other EU member states is available from [Eurostat's HICP web page](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/hicp/overview \"Eurostat's HICP webpage\"). \n\n3. **Methods - CPI and other measures of inflation**\n\n\tThe CPI, CPIH, RPIJ and RPI are compiled using the same underlying price data, based on a large and representative selection of around 700 individual goods and services for which price movements are measured in around 140 randomly selected areas throughout the UK. Around 180,000 separate price quotations are used every month to compile the indices. The outlets in which the prices are collected are selected randomly. Expenditure weights are held constant for 1 year at a time.\n\n\tThe selection of goods and services that are priced to compile these indices is reviewed annually. The contents of the 2015 basket are described in an article [Consumer Price Inflation: The 2015 Basket of Goods and Services (139.4 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi-basket-of-goods-and-services/cpi-2015-basket-of-goods.pdf \"CPI 2015 Basket of Goods\") . The expenditure weights used to compile the indices are also updated each year. Additional details of the updated weights for 2015 are available in an article published on 24 March 2015 entitled [Consumer Price Inflation: 2015 Weights (431.9 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/cpi-and-rpi--updating-weights/2015.pdf \"2015\") .\n\n\tRates of change for the CPI and CPIH are calculated from unrounded index levels, rather than from the published indices, which are rounded to 1 decimal place. The use of unrounded indices increases the accuracy of the calculation. The unrounded index levels for the CPI and CPIH are available from tables 64 and 65 of the [Consumer Price Inflation Reference Tables (2.22 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/cpi/consumer-price-indices/march-2015/consumer-price-inflation-reference-table.xls \"Consumer Price Inflation Reference Table\") .
