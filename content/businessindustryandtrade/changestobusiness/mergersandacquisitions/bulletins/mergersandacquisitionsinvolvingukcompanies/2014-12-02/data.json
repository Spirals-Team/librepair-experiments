      "markdown": "Mergers and Acquisitions (M\u0026A) transactions which result in a change of ultimate control of the target company and have a value of £1 million or more are included in this release. Information on the number and value of transactions are reported, in addition to whether transactions are acquisitions or disposals.\n\nFigures relating to mergers are included within acquisitions and those relating to demergers are contained within disposals. These statistics are presented on a ‘current price basis’, which are prices as they were at the time of measurement and are therefore not adjusted for inflation.\n\nThere were a total of 67 domestic and cross-border acquisitions involving UK companies in Q3 2014. This included 30 domestic transactions, 19 inward transactions and 18 outward transactions and represents a 26% fall on the previous quarter (90) and a 51% fall on the number recorded at Q3 2013 (138).\n\nThe quarterly numbers and value of M\u0026A activity are prone to large quarter-on-quarter movements as these data relate to specific ‘one time’ only transactions, for example one quarter can be heavily impacted by one large transaction.  Therefore it can be more appropriate to analyse trends over time. Overall, during the third quarter of 2014 the total number of domestic and cross-border mergers and acquisitions involving UK companies remain at much lower levels of activity than before and immediately after the 2008-09 the economic downturn. \n\n### Figure 1: Number of acquisitions involving UK companies 1990 - 2014\n[Figure 1-Chart]\n\nThe low level of overall M\u0026A activity during Q3 2014 can also be illustrated by looking at the average number and value of acquisitions over consecutive five-year intervals since 1997 (Table 1).\n\nOverall, at Q3 2014 the estimates for the number of acquisitions across all three M\u0026A surveys (outward, inwards and domestic) have all fallen below the respective average values per quarter since 2012.\n\nHowever, for the same comparison periods, the average value per transaction for both outward and domestic M\u0026A has increased. This is due to the inclusion of two large, substantive-valued acquisitions which completed during Q3 2014.        \n\n### Table 1: The average number and value of M\u0026A involving UK companies, grouped into five year intervals.\n[Table 1-Table]\n"

      "markdown": "During Q3 2014 there was a decrease of 35% in the number of quarter-on-quarter domestic M\u0026A involving UK companies. There were 30 completed domestic acquisitions reported in Q3 2014 compared with 46 in Q2 2014, and is the lowest number of domestic M\u0026A recorded since ONS first began publishing quarterly data (Q1 1969).\n\nIn contrast, the value of domestic acquisitions involving a change in majority share ownership increased between the second and third quarters of 2014 (from £1.3 billion in Q2 2014 to £2.9 billion in Q3 2014 – current price basis). This is the highest value recorded since Q1 2013 (£2.8 billion) (see Figure 2 below). The vast majority (69%) of the total value for domestic acquisitions at Q3 2014 (£2.9 billion) is represented by one large acquisition that occurred within the retail industry, for example [Carphone Warehouse Group PLC](http://www.investegate.co.uk/dixons-carphone-plc--cpw-/rns/completion-of-all-share-merger/201408070700144767O/ \"Carphone Warehouse Group PLC\") of the UK completed the all share merger of Dixons Retail Plc of the UK.\n\n### Figure 2: Value and number of acquisitions in the UK by other UK companies\n[Figure 2-Chart]\n\nDuring Q1 to Q3 2014 the combined total value of domestic M\u0026A (£5.8 billion) has fallen by 9% when compared with the total value of domestic M\u0026A (£6.4 billion) during the same three quarters of 2013.  However, the percentage decrease for the number of domestic M\u0026A during the same comparison periods appears much greater, reporting a 35% decrease, falling from 179 to 116 acquisitions. This may indicate that although fewer domestic acquisitions completed between these periods, the transactions which did were of a higher monetary value.\n\n### Figure 3: Summary of mergers and acquisitions in the UK by UK companies\n[Figure 3-Chart]\n\nIt is possible to split out the total number of domestic M\u0026A into those made by independently-controlled companies and those which are subsidiaries. The acquisition of an independent company means the purchase of a company in its entirety, whereas the acquisition of a subsidiary means the acquisition of a part of a company, between 50.1% to 100%.\n\nDuring Q3 2014 the number of acquisitions of independently-controlled companies (25), totalling £2.5 billion, represented the majority (83%) of the total number of completed domestic M\u0026A.\n\nIn comparison, domestic acquisitions involving subsidiaries between UK company groups, valued at £0.4 billion, accounted for 17% of the overall total number of domestic M\u0026A involving a change of majority ownership.\n\n### Other significant domestic acquisition, valued at £100 million or more, that took place during Q3 2014:\n\n- [Standard Life Investments Holdings of the UK](http://www.thephoenixgroup.com/~/media/Files/P/Phoenix-Group-%20V2/Attachments/pdf/26032014%20%20Divestment%20of%20Ignis%20Asset%20Management.pdf \"Standard Life Investments Holdings of the UK\") acquired Ignis Asset Management Ltd of the UK.\n\n- [Anacap Financial Partners LLP](http://www.investegate.co.uk/brightside-group-plc--brt-/rns/recommended-offer-for-brightside-group-plc/201405081530106343G/ \"Anacap Financial Partners LLP\") of the UK acquired Brightside Group PLC of the UK.     \n"

At Q3 2014 the number of inward acquisitions is the lowest number reported since Q1 1988, when 16 acquisitions were reported. \n\nDespite the downturn in the number of inward acquisitions during the first three quarters of 2014, the value of inward M\u0026A shows an increase on the previous quarter (Q2 2014). During Q3 2014 the estimates for the value of acquisitions in the UK made by investors overseas was £2.7 billion compared with £1.6 billion reported in the previous quarter (Q2 2014). This shows a quarter-on-quarter increase of approximately 69%.\n\nFurther analysis of inward M\u0026A shows that there were 69 completed acquisitions for Q1-Q3 2014 compared with 111 recorded for Q1-Q3 2013. This shows a year-on-year decrease of approximately 38%.\n\nAt Q3 2014 there were seven inward disposals of UK companies involving a change of majority ownership with a reported value of £1.0 billion. This is similar to the number of inward disposals that completed during Q3 2013 (eight), albeit then with a slightly lower reported value of £0.6billion.\n\n### The following significant transactions, valued at £100 million or more, that took place in the UK by foreign companies during Q3 2014:\n\n- [Phoenix Group Holdings](http://www.thephoenixgroup.com/~/media/Files/P/Phoenix-Group-V2/Attachments/pdf/26032014%20-%20Divestment%20of%20Ignis%20Asset%20Management.pdf \"Phoenix Group Holdings\") of The Cayman Islands disposed of Ignis Asset Management Ltd of the UK.\n\n- [K+S Baltic Offshore (Cyprus) Ltd](http://ir.kkr.com/kkr_ir/kkr_releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID\u003d858750 \"K+S Baltic Offshore (Cyprus) Ltd\") of Cyprus disposed of OCHL (Globe) Ltd of the UK.\n\n- [Packaging Coordinators Inc](http://pciservices.com/news/pci-completes-purchase-of-penn-pharma \"Packaging Coordinators Inc\") of the USA acquired Penn Pharmaceutical Services Ltd of the UK.\n\n- [Sanpower Group](http://press.houseoffraser.co.uk/downloads/press/word/Acquisition_of_House_of_Fraser_by_Nanjing_Cenbest_FINAL.pd \"Sanpower Group\") owner of Nanjing Xinjiekou Department Store Co Ltd of China acquired Highland Group Holdings Ltd of the UK.\n\n- [Viacom Inc](http://news.viacom.com/press-release/viacom-closes-acquisition-channel-5 \"Viacom Inc\") of the USA acquired Channel 5 Broadcasting Ltd of the UK.  \n\n- [Hony Capital Beijing Co Ltd](http://www.cinven.co.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases.aspx?mediaid\u003d507 \"Hony Capital Beijing Co Ltd\") of China acquired Pizza Express Ltd of the UK.\n\n- [Cirrus Logic INC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-28879198 \"Cirrus Logic INC\") of the USA acquired Wolfson Microelectronics Plc of the UK.\n\n- [KKR Management Holdings LP (USA)](http://ir.kkr.com/kkr_ir/kkr_releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID\u003d858750 \"KKR Management Holdings LP (USA)\") of the USA acquired OCHL (Globe) Ltd of the UK.\n\n- [Hexagon AB](http://www.verosoftware.com/news/articles/Hexagon-Acquires-Vero-Software \"Hexagon AB\") of Sweden acquired Vero Software Ltd of the UK.\n"

There were 18 completed acquisitions during Q3 2014, a 14% decrease when compared with the previous quarter (21). This flat trend of outward M\u0026A activity abroad by UK companies between the second and third quarters of 2014 appears to follow a similar pattern seen since 2012.\n\nIn contrast, the value of acquisitions abroad involving UK companies increased considerably to £6.3 billion during Q3 2014, from £2.4 billion reported in Q2 2014. This indicates that although fewer acquisitions completed during Q1 to Q3 2014, the transactions which did were of a higher monetary value.\n\nThis increased value of outward acquisitions in the Q3 2014 can be partially explained by one large completed acquisition within the telecommunications industry, for example [Vodafone Group Plc](http://www.investegate.co.uk/vodafone-group-plc--vod-/rns/vodafone-completes-eur7-2-bn-acquisition-of-ono/201407231116151072N/ \"\") of the UK acquired Grupo Corporativo Ono S.A. of Spain.\n\n### Other significant transaction, valued £100 million or more, that took place abroad by UK companies in Q3 2014:\n\n- [Man Group plc](http://www.investegate.co.uk/man-group-plc--emg-/rns/acquisition-of-numeric-holdings-llc/201406190700199868J/ \"Man Group plc\") of the UK acquired Numeric Holdings LLC of the USA.\n\n- [Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc](http://www.investegate.co.uk/rolls-royce-holdings--rr--/rns/acquisition/201408261516280420Q/ \"Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc\") of the UK acquired Rolls-Royce Power Systems (Tognum AG) of Germany.\n\n- [Cobham Plc](http://www.investegate.co.uk/cobham-plc--cob-/rns/aeroflex-acquisition-completed/201409150700126057R/ \"Cobham Plc\") of the UK acquired Aeroflex Holding Corp of the USA. \n"

      "title": "How our statistics compare with external evidence",
      "markdown": "Global merger, acquisitions and disposals activity is often driven by the availability of credit and company profits as well as a sense of confidence in the economic outlook. The majority of large M\u0026A transactions involve some element of borrowing or leveraging. Therefore when credit conditions deteriorate, as happened in the 2008-09 economic downturn, M\u0026A activity declines. On the other hand, the process of completing an M\u0026A transaction takes time and sometimes there may be a lag between improving economic conditions and any quarter-on-quarter increase in M\u0026A activity.\n\n[The Bank of England’s (BOE)](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/other/monetary/ccs/creditconditionssurvey141007.pdf \"The Bank of England’s (BOE)\") September 2014 Agents’ Summary of Business Conditions,  showed that corporate credit conditions had improved further and there is a growing desire among some companies to increase their capacity. On the other hand, the BOE Credit Conditions Survey for Q3 2014stated that demand for secured corporate credit from small businesses was reported to have decreased in Q3 2014. ; demand for lending from medium-sized companies and larger corporates had increased notably. The Bank of England’s (BOE) November Quarterly Inflation report also concluded that business investment growth has continued to rise this year with that from services industries contributing the most. \n\nThe [Organisation of Economic Corporation and Development (OECD)](http://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/investment-policy/InvestmentInsights-Nov2014.pdf \"Organisation of Economic Corporation and Development (OECD)\") 2014 Investment Insights paper dated November 2014 also appears to support the downward trend of global and domestic M\u0026A. Using data on M\u0026A investment it stated that international and domestic M\u0026A are both on track (based on data through Q3) to reach their lowest levels in a decade. Economic conditions that are holding back international investment in Europe would seem to be discouraging domestic investment as well.\n\n[Allen and Overy](http://www.allenovery.com/publications/en-gb/maindex/Pages/Downloads.aspx \"Allen and Overy\"), an international legal practice, reported in its M\u0026A index Q3 2014, that the surge in transactions was particularly marked as Q3 is typically quieter. However, transactions are continuing at a healthy pace and the pipeline of upcoming deals is strong enough to suggest the recovery will continue through to the year end and into 2015. In the same report it was stated that deal values in the first three quarters of 2014 are already higher than the same period of 2013, with average deal sizes at their highest level for many years.\n\nIn addition [Thomson Reuters](http://share.thomsonreuters.com/general/PR/MA-3Q14-(E).pdf \"Thomson Reuters\") reported in its Q3 2014 Mergers and Acquisitions Review,  that the overall volume of cross-border M\u0026A during the first nine months of 2014 more than doubled the levels reached during the first nine months of 2013. This review also suggests that the first nine months of 2014 appears to be the strongest for worldwide deal-making since 2007. \n"

Investment in the UK by UK companies (Domestic investment).\n\n\t2. Investment in the UK by foreign companies (Inward investment).\n\n\t3. Investment in foreign companies by UK companies (Outward investment).\n\n\n\tWithin ONS, M\u0026A data are essential for producing the National Accounts. The survey results form important components of the UK Balance of Payments and Financial Accounts and are vital in the measurement of the financial and non-financial business sector accounts. M\u0026A data is used in the compilation of the estimates for Foreign Direct Investment and additionally used by other government departments when preparing ministerial briefings. For example, HM Treasury, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, UK Trade \u0026 Investment and HM Revenue and Customs. The M\u0026A data estimates are also used by foreign embassies, economists and academics for research purposes and for periodic statistical comparisons.\n\n2. **Your views matter?**\n\n\tWe are constantly aiming to improve this release and its associated commentary.

We would really appreciate it if you will take around 10 minutes to complete our Opinion Survey to enable us to improve our outputs for you. \n\n3. **Basic quality information**\n\n\tThe [Quality and Methodology Information for Mergers and Acquisitions(M\u0026A) (300 Kb Pdf)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/quality/quality-information/business-statistics/quality-and-methodology-information-for-mergers-and-acquisitions--m-a--surveys-releases.pdf \"Quality and Methodology Information for Mergers and Acquisitions (M\u0026A) survey releases\") surveys report describes in detail the intended uses of the statistics presented in this publication, their general quality and the methods used to produce them.\n\n4. **Relevance to users**\n\n\tThe degree to which the statistical outputs meet users’ needs.\n\n\tWithin ONS, the mergers and acquisitions data are considered to be essential for producing the National Accounts. The survey results form important components of the UK Balance of Payments and Financial Accounts and are vital in the measurement of the financial and non-financial business sector accounts.\n\n\tThe Cross-Borders Acquisitions and Mergers survey (M\u0026A) data are used in the compilation of the estimates of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). These data meet the needs of FDI by collecting data on all acquisitions which lead to a holding in excess of 10% of the issued share capital. These estimates then feed into the UK Balance of Payments and the \u0027Rest of the World\u0027 sector of the financial accounts in the National Accounts, for which there is an EU legal requirement. Individual transaction information is also used to estimate the counterpart in \u0027portfolio\u0027 investment flows for monthly Balance of Payments. \n\n\tThe data collected are also used in updating business structures and country of ownership codes on the Inter-Departmental Business Register (IDBR). The IDBR is a comprehensive list of UK businesses that is used by government for statistical purposes.\n\n\t**Elsewhere in government, examples of departments who use the data include:**\n\n\t- HM Treasury, Economic Analysis Division, where the data are used in preparing briefing and forecasting;\n\n\t- Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, where direct investment data are required for ministerial briefing, parliamentary questions and in formulating trade policy;\n\n\t- UK Trade \u0026 Investment, where the information is used for briefing on the extent to which the UK is successful in attracting inward investment;\n\n\t -HM Revenue and Customs, where the data are used to help in forecasting company taxation.\n\n\t**Non-Government Users Include:**\n\n\t- Private companies which are interested in analysing country and industry data for trends by foreign firms in the UK and by UK companies abroad and also for researching corporate finance activity and for the purpose of investment banking;\n\n\t- UK embassies in foreign countries, who are interested in information on specific countries and companies making acquisitions, and\n\n\t- Private sector economists, journalists and academics who are interested in information on particular industries and particular countries for research purposes and who use the data for periodic statistical comparisons.\n\n\tFeedback from users has indicated that the information received from the M\u0026A survey has a high degree of relevance across the above user groups, meets the vast majority of user needs, and all information currently collected and published is used.\n\n\t**Source of data**:\n\n\tThe information collected is based on reports in the financial press, specialist magazines, company and financial websites supplemented by special surveys to businesses to determine the form, value and timing of each transaction.\n\n\tIf the information is not yet in the public domain, such transactions may not be reflected in the analysis. Where full information has not yet been received on the details of the acquisition or disposal, the value of the transaction indicated in the public domain is used as an interim estimate.\n\n\tThe data shown in this release relate solely to mergers and acquisitions undertaken by companies: acquisitions by individuals are not included.\n\n\tThis publication contains data relating mergers, demergers, acquisitions and disposals. Figures relating to mergers are included within acquisitions and those relating to demergers are contained within disposals.\n\n\tONS makes every effort to provide informative commentary on the data in this release. As part of the quality assurance process, individual businesses are contacted in an attempt to capture reasons for large period on period data movements. It can prove difficult to gather detailed reasons from some businesses to help inform the commentary. Frequently, reasons given for data movements refer to a ‘change in market conditions’ or a ‘restructure of the company’. Consequently, it’s not possible for all data movements to be fully explained.\n\n\tONS are aware that a number of users make use of these data for modelling or forecasting purposes. In doing so, it is important that users make note of our revisions policy (see note 9 in the background notes) and that all time series are on a ‘current price’ basis, which means that the values are as they were at the time of measurement and not adjusted for inflation. Acquisitions and disposal activity can be affected by UK and global economic and political issues and therefore quarterly estimates can be volatile.\n\n\tOne question often asked of the M\u0026A release is ‘why is there a time delay between the announcement of M\u0026A transactions in the press and the inclusion of these transactions within ONS M\u0026A figures?’ The difference is that ONS figures record when a transactions legally completes as opposed to when the transaction has been announced in the press. The complexities surrounding the acquisitions/disposals taking place often incurs a time lag, which can vary between quarters.\n\n5. **Significant transactions**\n\n\tSignificant Transactions tables show the reported figures for a selection of significant transactions which occurred in the quarter, where ‘significance’ is defined as the absolute value of the deal.\n\n\tThe figures shown are usually the ones available from the financial press or other sources in the public domain although occasionally, with the consent of the company, the value returned to ONS is used in the tables instead of the press reported figure. If the company’s consent cannot be obtained then the deal is excluded, however, the values are included in the aggregate tables. Occasionally, therefore, a large deal may be missing (suppressed) from the lists so it is best to regard these tables as an indication of the ranking of deals rather than a completely exhaustive listing.\n\n\tPress reported figures for M\u0026A transactions often differ to some extent from those supplied by companies to ONS and it is the latter which are used in compiling statistical aggregates in tables 1-10. Included in the prices quoted in the tables of significant transactions is the total published price paid for the company excluding any assumed debt where known. Deferred payments are included in the reported price even if the payment is made in a different quarter.\n\n6. **Types of transactions covered**\n\n\t**Mergers** are acquisitions in which all or part of the payment is made in shares, such that the shareholders of the two companies become shareholders of a new, combined company group.\n\n\t**Demergers** are disposals where a company group divides into two or more separate companies, in such a way that the shareholders of the restructured companies remain the same, or retain the equivalent value shareholding in one of the newly independent companies. Demergers are included in the statistics within disposals.\n\n\t**Acquisitions** are transactions which involve one company purchasing the ordinary shares of a second company (‘target company’). A target company is usually of a smaller size than the company undertaking the purchase.\n\n\t**Disposal** is a term used to describe the action when a company or organisation sells or liquidates the ordinary shares of a second company (‘target company’).\n\n\t**Cross-border acquisitions** denote transactions where a company in one country acquires, either directly or indirectly, a controlling interest in a company in another country.\n\n\t**Direct transactions** are those where a company acquires a controlling interest in another company.\n\n\t**Indirect transactions** are those where a company uses an existing foreign subsidiary to acquire a controlling interest in a company resident in another country. The acquiring foreign intermediate company may be located in the same country in which the acquisition is being made or in a different country.\n\n\t**Acquisitions within the UK by other UK companies** denote mergers and acquisitions involving only UK registered companies.\n\n\tWhere the acquired company was a subsidiary of another company the transaction is classified as a sale between company groups.\n\n\tThe phrase ‘acquisitions in the UK by UK companies’ refer to deals where the ultimate ownership remains in the UK. This heading does not cover the total number or value of deals where a UK company is the acquirer. When a foreign company acquires a UK company through one of its existing UK subsidiaries or a UK registered special purpose vehicle that deal is shown as part of the data under ‘acquisitions in the UK by foreign companies’.\n\n\t**Acquisition of independent companies**\n\n\tThe acquisition of an independent company means the purchase of a company in its entirety – the company itself and all of its subsidiaries.\n\n\t**Acquisition of subsidiary companies**\n\n\tThe acquisition of a subsidiary company means the \tpurchase of part of a company. \n\n7. **Financing**\n\n\tThis statistical bulletin provides details of the application of funds to effect mergers and acquisitions and the proceeds raised from disinvestments and demergers.\n\n\tFor indirect foreign transactions there is the added complication of considering the movements of funds either as capital injection or in the form of loans between parent companies and their foreign subsidiaries making the acquisition. Occasionally, the foreign subsidiary obtains the funds required partly or entirely outside the UK from sources such as:\n\n\t- Own resources\n\n\t- Borrowing from banks and other local sources\n\n\t- Share, bond and other capital or notes issued abroad\n\n\tAlso, a transaction may be funded by more than one method. \n\n8. **Definitions of geographic areas**\n\n\t### Table A: Definitions of geographic and economic areas\n\t[Table A-Table]\n\n9. **Revisions**\n\n\tData for Q1 and Q2 2014 has been revised in the light of new information, and so revisions to the data for Q1 and Q2 2014 have been published in this statistical bulletin. No further revisions to data prior to Q1 2014 have been made. Therefore time series data for all quarters of 2013 and any previous historic quarterly periods remain unchanged.\n\n\tAnnual data tables for 2013 are produced in conjunction with the Q4 2013 data. Revisions to the 2013 quarterly and annual figures are recalculated at Q1 2014 only. No revisions to annual data prior to 2013 have been made. Therefore time series data for previous historic annual periods remains unchanged.\n\n\tRevisions to the aggregates used in M\u0026A principally occur for the following reasons:\n\n\t- Completion of transactions: \nOn announcement of a proposed transaction an expected completion date is usually given. The publicly reported values will be allocated to the quarter of expected completion. If the transaction is ultimately completed in an earlier or later quarter, the recorded values will be reallocated to the new quarter.\n\n\t- Publicly reported values: \nPublicly reported values are initially used to compile the aggregates. These can vary considerably from the values ultimately supplied by the respondents, frequently because the assumption of debt has been included in the publicly reported value. A nominal value is applied if no publicly reported value is available. The final values used to create the aggregates are those supplied by the respondent.\n\n- Non-completion of transactions: \nOn announcement of a proposed transaction the publicly reported value of the transaction is recorded. If the transaction does not subsequently take place the recorded value will be deleted.\n\n\t- Non-share transactions: \nOn announcement of a proposed transaction it may appear that there will be transactions in the share capital of the companies involved and the publicly reported values will be recorded. If subsequent information contradicts this the recorded values will be amended or deleted.\n\n\t- Control: \nOn announcement of a proposed transaction it may appear that the transaction will give the purchasing company control of the purchased company, that is, a share ownership of greater than 50%. If subsequent information contradicts this the recorded values will be amended or deleted.\n\n\t- Revisions from respondents: \nVery occasionally respondents revise the values that they have previously supplied to ONS. The revised values are those used to create the aggregates.\n\n\tAnalysing average revisions between provisional and final estimates can provide an indication of reliability in an initial statistic. Provisional statistics may be based on less information than is available for final statistics as they have been processed more quickly to meet the demand of customers. By looking at these average revisions it can help us determine whether revisions are being made consistently in one direction for example; if early estimates are consistently under or overestimating the later figures. A test is subsequently performed on these average revisions to determine if they are statistically different from zero. Revisions that are not statistically significant imply that an average revision might be non-zero simply through random effects.\n\n\t### Table B: Average Revisions over the Previous Five Quarters\n\t[Table B-Table]\n\n\t### Table C: Average Revisions over the Previous Five Quarters\n\t[Table C-Table]\n\n10. **Response rates**\n\n\t### Table D: Response rates\n\t[Table D-Table]\n\n11. **Notes to tables**\n\n\tThe deal identification threshold was increased at Q1 2010 to a value of £1.0 million from a previous value of £0.1 million. As a consequence there is a discontinuity in the value and number of deals reported from Q1 2010 onwards compared with previous periods.\n\n\tSymbols used in the tables are:\n\n\t.. Figure suppressed to avoid disclosure of information relating to individual enterprises. \n\t– Nil or less than half the final digit shown.\n\n\tThe sum of constituent items in tables may not always agree exactly with the totals shown due to rounding.\n\n12. **Disclosure**\n\n\tIt is sometimes necessary to suppress figures for certain items in order to avoid disclosing information about an individual business. Further information on why data are suppressed is available in the [ONS Disclosure Control Policy (337 Kb Word document)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/best-practice/disclosure-control-policy-for-tables/disclosure-control-policy-for-tables-produced-from-surveys.pdf \"Disclosure Control Policy for tables produced from surveys\") . \n\n13. **Office for National Statistics**\n\n\tThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) is the executive office of the UK Statistics Authority, a non-ministerial department which reports directly to Parliament. ONS is the UK government\u0027s single largest statistical producer. It compiles information about the UK\u0027s society and economy, and provides the evidence-base for policy and decision-making, the allocation of resources, and public accountability. The Director General of ONS reports directly to the National Statistician who is the Authority\u0027s Chief Executive and the Head of the Government Statistical Service.\n\n\tThe UK Statistics Authority has reviewed this publication in their report: “[Assessment of compliance with the Code of Practice for Official Statistics”: Statistics of International Transactions](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/stats-authority/uk-statistics-authority--assessment-reports.html \"UK Statistics Authority: assessment reports\"), which was published on 8 December 2011. This review recommended that the Mergers and Acquisitions estimates be designated as National Statistics, subject to ONS carrying out certain requirements. ONS met all of these requirements on 3 May 2013.\n\n\tDesignation can be broadly interpreted to mean that the statistics:\n\n\t- meet identified user needs;\n\n\t- are well explained and readily accessible;\n\n\t- are produced according to sound methods, and\n\n\t- are managed impartially and objectively in the public interest.\n\n\tOnce statistics have been designated as National Statistics it is a statutory requirement that the Code of Practice shall continue to be observed. \n\n14. **Social media**\n\n\tFollow ONS on [Twitter](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/twitter.html \"Twitter\") and receive up to date information about our statistics.\n\n\tLike ONS on [Facebook](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/index.html \"Facebook\") to receive our updates in your newsfeed and to post comments on our page.\n\n\tWatch our videos on [YouTube](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/youtube.html \"YouTube\").\n\n15. **The Government Statistical Service (GSS)**\n\n\tThe Government Statistical Service is a network of professional statisticians and their staff operating both within the Office for National Statistics and across more than 30 other government departments and agencies.\n\n16. **Government Statistical Service (GSS) Business Statistics**\n\n\tTo find out about other official business statistics, and choose the right data for your needs, use the [GSS Business Statistics Interactive User Guide](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/understanding-ons-statistics/business-statistics---interactive-user-guide/index.html \"GSS Business statistics - interactive user guide\").
