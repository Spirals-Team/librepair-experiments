As a result the UK Statistics Authority announced its decision to suspend the designation of Output and New Orders as National Statistics in respect of the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) took responsibility for the publication and development of the Construction Price and Cost Indices from the Department for Business Innovation & Skills (BIS) on 1 April 2015. Since this point, we have worked towards creating an [interim solution](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ppi2/construction-output-price-indices--opis-/interim-solution--q1-2015/index.html \"Construction output price industries (OPIs), interim solution, Q1 2015\") to measure output prices and replace the statistical models that had been used in the production of chained volume measures (CVMs) for output in the construction industry since quarter 3 (July to Sept) 2014 and to provide an ongoing source of data from quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2015 onwards. We have also launched a [consultation](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/HDSR6PW \"consultation\") to gather feedback from users to help us improve this methodology and understand more about how the CPCIs are used.\n\nConstruction output estimates are a short-term indicator of construction output by the private sector and public corporations within Great Britain and are produced from a monthly survey of 8,000 businesses in Great Britain. The estimates are produced and published at current prices (including inflationary price effects) and at chained volume estimates (with inflationary effects removed) both seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted.\n\nChained volume measures are also described as volume. Construction output is used in the compilation of the output approach to measuring [gross domestic product (GDP)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa2/second-estimate-of-gdp/index.html \"Second estimate of GDP index\").\n\nDetailed estimates along with a longer run of time series data are available to download in the Output in the Construction Industry, May 2015 reference tables. In these tables, users will find chained volume estimates back to quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 1997, and monthly estimates back to January 2010. Current price non-seasonally adjusted data are available back to quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 1955.

The chart shows that the monthly path for construction output is a volatile one. After sustained growth since early 2013, there have been falls in both all new work, and repair and maintenance in recent periods. Both all new work, and repair and maintenance contributed to the fall in all work in May 2015.\n\nBefore we discuss each component, it is worth noting the change in the non-seasonally adjusted series.\n\n####Figure 2: All work-monthly time series chained volume measures, seasonally adjusted (SA) and non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) Index (2011=100)\n#####Great Britain, January 2010 to May 2015\n[![Figure 2: All work-monthly time series chained volume measures, seasonally adjusted (SA) and non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) Index (2011=100)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure2_tcm77-410357.png \"Figure 2: All work-monthly time series chained volume measures, seasonally adjusted (SA) and non-seasonally adjusted (NSA) Index (2011=100)\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure2_tcm77-410357.png)\n#####Source: Construction: Output & Employment - Office for National Statistics\n\nFigure 2 shows the non-seasonally adjusted volume of all work in May 2015 did increase, but the increase of 0.6% in May 2015 compared with April 2014 was not as high as seen in previous April to May comparisons. As such, seasonal adjustment has resulted in this small increase in non-seasonally adjusted terms to become a contraction.\n\nFigure 3 shows the components that make up all new work. The chart shows that there were falls in new housing and other new work in May 2015, while infrastructure has increased. While new housing has fallen this month the underlying pattern since early 2013 continued to show growth. Infrastructure has continued at a fairly constant level while other new work is showing a slight decline.\n\n####Figure 3: Components of all new work, monthly time series, seasonally adjusted chained volume measure £ million\n#####Great Britain, January 2010 to May 2015\n[![Figure 3: Components of all new work, monthly time series, seasonally adjusted chained volume measure £ million](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure3_tcm77-410359.png \"Figure 3: Components of all new work, monthly time series, seasonally adjusted chained volume measure £ million\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure3_tcm77-410359.png)\n#####Source: Construction: Output & Employment - Office for National Statistics\n\nFigure 4 looks at the 2 components of repair and maintenance. In May 2015, non-housing repair and maintenance caused the fall in all repair and maintenance while there was no change in housing repair and maintenance. The underlying level of both non-housing and housing repair and maintenance is similar, however, non-housing is the more volatile component.\n\n####Figure 4: Components of repair and maintenance, monthly time series, seasonally adjusted (SA) chained volume measures £ million\n#####Great Britain, January 2010 to May 2015\n[![Figure 4: Components of repair and maintenance, monthly time series, seasonally adjusted (SA) chained volume measures £ million](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure4_tcm77-410360.png \"Figure 4: Components of repair and maintenance, monthly time series, seasonally adjusted (SA) chained volume measures £ million\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure4_tcm77-410360.png)\n#####Source: Construction: Output & Employment - Office for National Statistics\n\n<ons-table path=\"/businessindustryandtrade/constructionindustry/bulletins/outputintheconstructionindustry/2015-07-10/289157eb\" />\n\n###Summary of growth rates for all work types\n\nTable 2 provides a summary of growth rates across the different types of construction work in May 2015. Some main points from this table are as follows:\n\n- all work types except infrastructure and public new housing saw a decrease in the month-on-month growth rate; the main contribution to the fall was private new housing\n\n- the month-on-month fall in all new work was due to a decrease in both total housing and other new work\n\n- year-on-year there was a mixed picture with most work types reporting decreases, however, the larger weights in private new housing, infrastructure and private housing repair and maintenance resulted in a rise in all work\n\n<ons-table path=\"/businessindustryandtrade/constructionindustry/bulletins/outputintheconstructionindustry/2015-07-10/1423513a\" />\n"},{"title":"Construction estimates in gross domestic product (GDP)","markdown":"Construction estimates are a main component of the output approach to measuring GDP along with the estimates of services, production and agriculture. As an aid to users, the short-term economic indicator releases that directly feed into GDP include an additional table of the GDP components. It is anticipated that this table will inform users of the relationship between the individual components which comprise GDP output. The publication dates and the quarterly growths of the individual GDP components appear in this section.\n\nEach component of GDP has a weight within GDP based on its value in 2011. Construction has a weight of 64, which means that it is 64 parts of the 1,000 that make up total GDP.\n\nTo determine the effect each component has on GDP multiply the component growth by its weight in GDP.\n\nAn example using quarter 2, April to June 2014 data:\n\nConstruction growth  = 0.7 \nWeight in GDP  = 0.064 (64/1000) \nEffect on GDP  = 0.7 * 0.064 = 0.0448 or 0.0 to 1 decimal place (dp)\n\nRevisions to components and the effect on GDP can be calculated using the same process. As a general rule there are no revisions to GDP when the component revisions are:\n\nIndex of Production (IoP) = between 0.3 and -0.3 \nConstruction = between 0.7 and -0.7 \nIndex of Services (IoS) = 0.0 (all values above or below 0.0 effect GDP due to the high weight of IoS in GDP).\n\nBecause;\n\nIoP = 0.146*0.4 = 0.0584 or 0.1 to 1 dp  \nConstruction =  0.064*0.8 = 0.0512 or 0.1 to 1 dp \nIoS = 0.784*0.1 = 0.0784 or 0.1 to 1 dp\n\nTable 3 shows the latest monthly and revised quarterly output figures that fed into the Quarterly National Accounts release for quarter 1 (Jan to Mar) 2015 published on 30 June 2015.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/businessindustryandtrade/constructionindustry/bulletins/outputintheconstructionindustry/2015-07-10/42ae2b92\" />\n\nThe Quarterly National Accounts published on 30 June 2015 contained an estimate for quarterly construction of a fall of 0.2%. This estimate has not been revised within this release."},{"title":"The quality of the estimate of output in the construction industry","markdown":"Output in the construction industry estimates are produced from the monthly business survey on the second Friday of the month, 2 months after the reporting month. Revised results, for previously published periods, are published in line with the national accounts revisions policy. More information about the data content for this release can be found in the background notes. Revisions are an inevitable consequence of the trade-off between timeliness and accuracy. The response rate in May 2015 was 70.8% of questionnaires, accounting for 79.0% of registered turnover in the construction industry. Therefore the estimate is subject to revisions as more data become available.\n\nThe monthly output in the construction industry time series now spans 65 months, however, users should note that 60 months is the minimum time span recommended by Eurostat for seasonal adjustment. While the seasonal pattern is generally established after 60 months in a monthly time series, there is still potential for increased revisions until the seasonal pattern has matured.\n\nUsers should note that the deflators used in the production of chained volume estimates of output in the construction industry have been created using a statistical model of the quarter 3, July to September 2014 tender price indices and (TPIs) and output price indices (OPIs). This is the second quarter where these deflators have been created using this statistical model and users should note that the confidence intervals surrounding these models are wide and caution should be taken when using the deflated estimates. More information on these statistical models can be found in the updated article Modelling Construction Statistics Deflators.\n\nAll estimates, by definition, are subject to statistical uncertainty and for many well-established statistics we measure and publish the sampling error associated with the estimate, using this as an indicator of accuracy. For construction output, we publish sample and non-sample errors in table 11 of the main reference tables. It should be noted that we are continually working on methodological changes to improve the accuracy of the construction output estimates, progress on these can be found on the [ONS continuous improvement](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/ons-statistical-continuous-improvement/index.html \"continuous improvement of Gross Domestic Product\") page on our website."},{"title":"Economic context","markdown":"Construction output fell by 1.3% in May 2015 following a fall of 0.5% in April 2015. As a result of these consecutive, negative monthly outturns, the annual growth rate has eased from a recent peak of 11.2% in December 2014 to 1.3% in May 2015. These data suggest that output in the construction industry as a whole has been broadly flat over the last 2 quarters, a marked slowdown compared with the industry’s performance during the broader economic recovery. Much of this easing is due to lower house building output growth, which has softened considerably in 2015.\n\nOn an annual basis, construction output grew by 1.3%, driven by the new work category. The strongest sub-component of new work was infrastructure, which increased by 16.2% in the year to May 2015. This was reflected in the [Bank of England's Agents' Summary of Business Conditions for June](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/agentssummary/default.aspx \"Bank of England's Agents' Summary of Business Conditions for June\"), which reported steady growth in commercial construction and infrastructure output. Higher housing output also made a contribution to output growth over this period. New work for housing grew by 4.6% driven by private housing, whereas public housing contracted. The Agents also noted that house building growth has been more modest than a year ago, partly due to skill shortages. Repair and maintenance exerted downward pressure on growth.\n\nComparing May 2015 with the previous month, the fall in construction output was driven by both new work, and repair and maintenance. New work fell by -1.5%, largely as a consequence of house building which contracted by 5.8%, which may in turn reflect changing house price expectations. The [ONS House Price Index (HPI)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/house-price-index/april-2015/index.html \"April 2015\") showed that UK house prices increased by 5.5% in April 2015, a fall from 9.6% in March 2015 and is indicative of a broader slowing of house price growth which may influence the incentives of developers. The easing of housing output growth was also noted in the [Bank of England's Inflation Report for May 2015](http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2015/may.aspx \"Bank of England's Inflation Report for May 2015\"), which indicated that housing investment growth is expected to rise only modestly in 2015. The report highlighted that housing starts fell in quarter 2 (Apr to Jun) 2014 and that this was likely to feed through to lower investment in new dwellings in subsequent quarters.\n\nAll components of other new work excluding infrastructure also contracted on a monthly basis. Despite falling output for the sub-categories of other new work excluding infrastructure, [HMRC's property transaction statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/monthly-property-transactions-completed-in-the-uk-with-value-40000-or-above \"HMRC's property transaction statistics\") show that non-residential property transactions were 6.4% higher in May 2015 compared with a year earlier, suggesting some pick-up in demand. In contrast, there was upward pressure on new work from infrastructure which increased by 5.7% on the month. Taken together, the easing of the growth rate of construction output is consistent with external indicators."},{"title":"International perspective","markdown":"Output in the construction industry follows the [Eurostat Short Term Statistics (STS)](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=1916630&p_v_l_s_g_id=0 \"Eurostat Short Term Statistics (STS)]\") regulation for production in construction. Before any comparisons are made with the euro area or EU28, it is worth noting that the UK is the only member state to follow the A method for compiling [production in construction statistics](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/en/web/products-manuals-and-guidelines/-/KS-RA-11-018 \"production in construction statistics\").\n\nThe latest release of [production in construction](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-press-releases/-/4-17062015-BP \"production in construction\") showed that construction output in the euro area (EA19) increased by 0.3% and fell by 0.3% in the EU28 in April 2015 compared with March 2015. The GB estimate for April 2015 showed that construction output decreased 0.5%. It should be noted that an accurate comparison cannot be made as Eurostat data are calculated on a 2010 = 100 basis, while GB data are calculated on a 2011 = 100 basis.\n\nOutside of the EU, the US Census Bureau release [Value of construction put in place](https://www.census.gov/construction/c30/c30index.html \"Value of construction put in place\") showed provisional estimates of construction output increased by 0.8% in May 2015 compared with April 2015 and increased by 8.2% compared with May 2014."}],"accordion":[{"title":"Background notes","markdown":"1. **Future developments**\n\n\tWe are unable to load Construction Output data onto a time series data set, however, the data will be available on our data explorer page early next week.

In line with this, the construction output release for May 2015 has a revision period back to April 2015.\n\n\tFigures for the most recent months are provisional and subject to revision in light of (a) late responses to the monthly business survey (MBS) and (b) revisions to seasonal adjustment factors which are re-estimated every period.\n\n3. **Revisions**\n\n\tOne indication of the reliability of the main indicators can be obtained by monitoring the size of revisions. Analysis of the previously published quarterly seasonally adjusted chained volume measure series has shown that revisions to construction data are small. Generally these quarterly revisions are less than 1 percentage point when compared with the final revised period 5 quarters after initial publication. This indicates that the published estimates are a reliable snapshot of the output in the industry at the date of publication.\n\n\tThe size and pattern of revisions for both output and new orders data which have occurred in the open period can be found in the new revision triangles on the construction web page. Please note that these indicators only report summary measures for revisions. The revised data may be subject to sampling or other sources of error. Details about this revisions material can be found in the document “Revisions information in ONS First Release”.\n\n\tIt should be noted that due to seasonal adjustment taking place on a short span of data points used to interpret the seasonal effects, there is potential for increased revisions until the seasonal pattern is established within the time series. The seasonal pattern is generally established after 60 months in a monthly time series.\n\n\tPlease note that a monthly seasonally adjusted chained volume series is not available pre-2010. This is due to monthly data not being available for this period. These data are a requirement for creating previous year’s prices from which chain linked volume measures are created.\n\n4. **Use of the data**\n\n\tOutput in the Construction Industry estimates are widely used both internally and externally and have been identified by legal requirement and user engagement surveys.\n\n\tThe main users of data from the Output of the Construction Industry dataset are:\n\n\t- United Kingdom National Accounts.\n\n\t- Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, in order to comply with statutory legislation on short-term business statistics (STS) - short-term business statistics provide information on the economic development of 4 major domains: industry, construction, retail trade and other services\n\n\t- industry analysts requiring estimates of the construction industry output of Great Britain\n\n\t- trade associations making UK and international comparisons and to forecast trends in the construction industry\n\n\t- other government departments including; the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS), HM Treasury (HMT), Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) and the Office for Budgetary Responsibility (OBR)\n\n\tAs well as being a main indicator of the performance of construction companies, the results of the survey also contribute to the estimate of the gross domestic product of the UK, contributing approximately 6.4% of GDP.\n\n\tMore information on the uses made of [short-term economic statistics](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/economy/output-measure-of-gdp/methods-and-sources/index.html \"Methods of sources\") is available on our website.\n\n5. **Methods**\n\n\tThe ONS Monthly Construction Output Survey measures output from the construction industry in Great Britain.
