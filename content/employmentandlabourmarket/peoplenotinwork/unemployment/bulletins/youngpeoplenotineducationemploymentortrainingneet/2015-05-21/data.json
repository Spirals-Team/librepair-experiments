Estimates are also produced for the age groups 16 to 17 and 18 to 24 and broken down by gender.\n\n### Education and training\n\nA person is considered to be in education or training if any of the following apply:\n\n- they are enrolled on an education course and are still attending or waiting for term to (re)start\n\n- they are doing an apprenticeship\n\n- they are on a government supported employment or training programme\n\n- they are working or studying towards a qualification, or\n\n- they have had job-related training or education in the last 4 weeks\n\n### Employment\n\n“In employment” includes all people in some form of paid work, including those working part-time. People not in employment are classed as either unemployed or economically inactive. Unemployed people are those who have been looking for work in the past 4 weeks and who are available to start work within the next 2 weeks. Economically inactive people are those who have not been looking for work and/or who are not available to start work. Examples of economically inactive people include those not looking for work because they are students and those who are looking after dependants at home. These definitions are based on those recommended by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).\n\n### NEET\n\nAnybody who is not in any of the forms of education or training listed above and who is not in employment, is considered to be NEET. Consequently, a person identified as NEET will always be either unemployed or economically inactive.\n\n### Relationship to other labour market statistics for young people\n\nThe ONS monthly labour market statistical bulletin includes the [reference table A06 (2.57 Mb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/labour-market-statistics/may-2015/table-a06.xls \"Table A06\") “Educational status, economic activity and inactivity of young people”. The NEET statistics and the Table A06 statistics are both derived from the Labour Force Survey and use the same labour market statuses; however the educational statuses are derived differently. For Table A06 the educational status is based on participation in full-time education only. For NEET statistics the educational status is based on any form of education or training, as listed previously. Therefore, the Table A06 category “not in full-time education” includes some people who are in part-time education and/or some form of training and who, consequently, should not be regarded as NEET.\n"},{"title":"Total Young People who were Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET)","markdown":"For January to March 2015, there were 943,000 young people (aged from 16 to 24) who were Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET), down 20,000 from October to December 2014 and down 45,000 from a year earlier.

Surveys gather information from a sample rather than from the whole population. The sample is designed carefully to allow for this, and to be as accurate as possible given practical limitations like time and cost constraints, but results from sample surveys are always estimates, not precise figures. This means that they are subject to some uncertainty. This can have an impact on how changes in the estimates should be interpreted, especially for short-term comparisons.\n\nWe can calculate the level of uncertainty (also called “sampling variability”) around a survey estimate by exploring how that estimate would change if we were to draw many survey samples for the same time period instead of just one. This allows us to define a range around the estimate (known as a “confidence interval”) and to state how likely it is in practice that the real value that the survey is trying to measure lies within that range. Confidence intervals are typically set up so that we can be 95% sure that the true value lies within the range – in which case we refer to a “95% confidence interval”.\n\nFor example, the total number of people Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) aged 16 to 24 for October to December 2014 was estimated to be 963,000. This figure had a stated 95% confidence interval of +/- 52,000. This means that we can be 95% certain that the true total number of people NEET aged 16 to 24 for October to December 2014 was between 911,000 and 1.015 million. However, the best estimate from the survey was that the total number of people NEET aged 16 to 24 was 963,000.\n\nThe percentage of people NEET aged 16 to 24 for the same period was estimated at 13.2%, with a stated 95% confidence interval of +/- 0.7%. This means that we can be 95% sure that the percentage of people NEET was between 12.5% and 13.9%. Again, the best estimate from the survey was that the percentage of people NEET aged 16 to 24 was 13.2%.\n\nThe sampling variability estimates are updated annually in this bulletin.\n\n### Working with uncertain estimates\n\nIn general, changes in the numbers (and especially the rates) reported in this Statistical Bulletin between three month periods are small, and are not usually greater than the level that is explainable by sampling variability. In practice, this means that small, short-term movements in reported rates (for example within +/- 0.3 percentage points) should be treated as indicative, and considered alongside medium and long-term patterns in the series and corresponding movements in administrative sources, where available, to give a fuller picture.\n\n### Seasonal adjustment and uncertainty\n\nLike many economic indicators, the labour market is affected by factors that tend to occur at around the same time every year; for example school leavers entering the labour market in July and whether Easter falls in March or April. In order to compare movements other than annual changes in labour market statistics, such as since the previous quarter or since the previous month, the data are seasonally adjusted to remove the effects of seasonal factors and the arrangement of the calendar. Estimates discussed in this Statistical Bulletin are presented seasonally adjusted. While seasonal adjustment is essential to allow for robust comparisons through time, it is not possible to estimate uncertainty measures for the seasonally adjusted series.\n\n[Table NEET 2 (27.5 Kb Excel sheet)](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/lms/young-people-not-in-education--employment-or-training--neets-/may-2015/rft---table-2.xls \"RFT - Table 2\") shows the sampling variability of the NEET estimates derived from the Labour Force Survey.\n"},{"title":"Background notes","markdown":"1.
