level and rate of UK unemployment is measured by the Labour Force Survey (LFS), using a definition of unemployment specified by the International Labour Organisation. This defines unemployed people as those without a job who have been actively seeking work in the past 4 weeks and are available to start work in the next 2 weeks. It also includes those who are out of work but have found a job and are waiting to start it in the next 2 weeks. "},"relatedArticles":[]}
