It provides useful information for those interested in what adults use the Internet for, the type of purchases made online and how homes in Great Britain connected to the Internet.\n\nThe Internet has changed the way people go about their daily lives. Almost three quarters of adults in Great Britain used the Internet everyday (73%) in 2013, with 6 out of every 10 adults (61%) using a mobile phone or portable computer to access the Internet 'on the go'.\n\nIn 2013, more people than ever before used the Internet for reading newspapers or magazines (55%), to access their bank accounts (50%), to seek health information (43%) or to buy groceries (21%). This release highlights that activities previously carried out on the high street, are now increasingly being carried out online.\n\nThis release reveals that adults aged 25 to 34 used the Internet more than any other age group to carry out a wide range of established ‘every day’ activities, such as purchasing goods or services online (92%), Internet banking (76%) and selling goods online (45%).\n\nThe results in this release are derived from the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. On 14 August 2013, ONS will publish the latest quarterly statistics on adults who have ever or never used the Internet within the [Internet Access Quarterly Update, Q2 2013 statistical bulletin](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/internet-access-quarterly-update/q2-2013.html \"Internet Access Quarterly Update, Q2 2013\"). The quarterly estimates are derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The LFS has a much larger sample than the Opinions and Lifestyle survey and therefore allows for more detailed socio-demographic analysis to be undertaken. The Quarterly Update should be used as ONS’ official source for the number of individuals in Great Britain accessing the Internet.\n\nONS first collected statistics on Internet access in 1998. Since then, a number of changes have been made to the Internet Access survey, including the publication of annual results since 2006. Where possible, comparisons over time are made in this release. However, the available coverage for time series comparisons varies, because the questions included in the survey vary each year.

Use of a computer is inextricably linked to the ability of an individual to use the Internet. In 2013, 70% of adults in Great Britain used a computer every day, up from 45% in 2006.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2013-08-08/f465baf6\" />\n\nA sizable increase in daily computer use, by age, in the past seven years has been for adults aged 65 and over. In 2006, just 9% reported that they used a computer every day, this compares to 37% in 2013."},{"title":"Frequency of internet use","markdown":"In 2013, 36 million adults in Great Britain used the Internet every day, or almost every day. This represented 73% of those aged 16 and over and was more than double the number of adults (16 million) that used the Internet daily in 2006 (when directly comparable records began). Daily Internet use has increased by 2.5 million since 2012.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2013-08-08/eaeaf372\" />\n\nUse of the Internet on a daily basis has increased markedly in a short space of time, from 35% of all adults in 2006 to 73% in 2013. Correspondingly, there has been a drop in the number of adults who use the Internet on a weekly basis, from 16% in 2006 to just 9% in 2013."},{"title":"Internet activities","markdown":"There are distinct differences in how individuals make use of the Internet when analysed by age. As ‘early-adopters’, it is of little surprise that those adults in the two youngest age groups (16 to 24 and 25 to 34)  are proportionately the largest users of many of the Internet activities surveyed.\n\nIn 2013, adults aged 16 to 24 were most likely to engage in online activities that focused on leisure or recreation; especially new activities such as social networking (93%), consulting wikis (60%), downloading software (55%) and telephoning or making video calls over the Internet via a webcam (40%).\n\nAdults aged 25 to 34 reported the highest level of use in many of the activities surveyed, in particular day-to-day activities such as sending emails (89%) and finding information about goods and services (77%). This trend is particularly evident when considering online banking where over three quarters (76%) of those aged 25 to 34 accessed their bank accounts over the Internet. This compares to only half of all adults (50%).\n\nThe Internet provides a popular alternative to many of the traditional ways of completing every day tasks. For example, in 2007, approximately only one in five adults (18%) used the Internet to access health information using websites such as NHS direct. In 2013, 43% of all adults had used the Internet to find health information online. Among those aged 25 to 34 the rate of use increased to nearly 6 in 10 (59%).\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2013-08-08/216505eb\" />\n\nIn 2013, with reports of decreased physical newspaper readership, there has been media interest in how people will access the news in the future. Over half of all adults (55%) used the Internet to read or download the news, newspapers or magazines in 2013, compared to only 20% of adults in 2007. Those aged 25 to 34 (72%) were most likely to read or download news online. Almost half (49%) of 55 to 64 year olds reported that they now access news online.\n\nSocial networking has been one of the major success stories of the Internet age and its use continues to grow. In 2013, over half (53%) of all adults participated in social networking, up from 48% in 2012. Almost all adults aged 16 to 24 (93%) have used social networks, but it is important to note that its use is not solely confined to the youngest age groups, with one in every two adults (50%) aged 45 to 54 year olds now reporting that they partake in social networking.\n\nThere has been significant growth, in the last six years, in adults selling goods or services online. In 2007, only 1 in 10 adults (12%) used sites such as eBay or Gumtree to sell goods online. This had more than doubled by 2013, with 28% of adults selling goods over the Internet. Of those aged 25 to 34, just under half (45%) reported that they had now sold goods or services online.\n\nUsing services related to travel and travel related accommodation is one of only three activities favoured by those aged 55 to 64 to a greater degree than the youngest age group aged 16 to 24; at 51% and 46% respectively. In total, one in every two adults (50%) indicated that they used the Internet for this activity.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2013-08-08/d62a83ac\" />"},{"title":"Unemployment and the use of the internet","markdown":"The Internet has become a key tool for those looking for work.\n\nIn 2013, two thirds (67%) of unemployed adults had looked for a job or submitted a job application online. Just over half of unemployed adults (54%) reported that they had looked on the Internet for information about education, training or courses.\n\nApproximately two thirds (67%) of those who were unemployed indicated that their computer skills were sufficient if they needed to start a new job. This figure compares to 72% of adults currently in employment.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2013-08-08/7fbb4715\" />"},{"title":"Internet shopping","markdown":"The convenience of Internet shopping has proved very popular for consumers. The Eurostat report ‘[Internet use in households and by individuals in 2012](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-12-050/EN/KS-SF-12-050-EN.PDF \"Internet use in households and by individuals in 2012\")’ which published data relating to UK residents aged 16 to 74 (rather than for all adults, including those aged over 74 years, in Great Britain which is the basis of this statistical bulletin), compared rates of online shopping across the EU. It reported that the UK had the highest rate of online purchasing, with 82% of Internet users buying online, slightly ahead of Norway at 80%, followed by Denmark and Sweden both at 79%.\n\n####Map 1: Internet purchasing by individuals in the last 12 months by country, 2012\n[![Map 1: Internet purchasing by individuals in the last 12 months by country, 2012](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/mapinternetusagepurchases_tcm77-322737.png \"Map 1: Internet purchasing by individuals in the last 12 months by country, 2012\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/mapinternetusagepurchases_tcm77-322737.png) \n#####Source: Eurostat\n\nIn 2013, as regular stories appear in the media reporting the decline of the high street, it is interesting to note that almost three quarters (72%) of all adults reported buying goods or services online. This has risen from 53% since 2008. While younger age groups have traditionally embraced Internet shopping (92% of 25 to 34 year olds), there has been significant growth in the rate of online purchasing by those aged over 65. Over a third of those aged 65 and over bought online (36%) in 2013, more than double the 2008 estimate of 16%.\n\nClothes were the most popular online purchase in 2013, bought by 47% of all adults. Those aged 25-34 were most likely to buy these items (68%). In 2013, half of all women (50%) bought clothes online, compared with 45% of men.\n\nThere is a noticeable difference in the type of goods bought online, when analysed by age. In 2013, for example, only 15% of those aged 16 to 24 bought food and groceries online, compared with 34% of those aged 35 to 44.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2013-08-08/eefb86b0\" />"},{"title":"Downloads","markdown":"In 2013, one in every two adults (50%) who bought films or music online downloaded the content or accessed it via a streaming website such as Lovefilm or Netflix.

In 2013, the 4G network is set to expand, with more providers due to launch 4G services. Recent developments have not only been limited to mobile broadband, with the availability of wireless (wifi) hotspots increasing at a rapid rate. Leading companies provide thousands of hotspots across the country. These are now regularly seen at locations such as pubs, cafes and hotels. The availability of both mobile broadband and wifi networks means the mobile Internet is now used by more people than ever before.\n\nIn 2013, 6 in 10 adults (61%) had used a device such as mobile phone or portable computer (a tablet or laptop) to access the mobile Internet, away from home or work. Almost all those aged 16 to 24 (94%) had used a mobile phone or portable device to access the Internet “on the go”, compared with only 17% of those aged 65 or above.\n\nThe most popular device used to access the Internet ‘on the go’ was a mobile phone, with over half of all adults (53%) accessing the Internet this way. This has more than doubled since the 2010 estimate of 24%.\n\n[![Internet use, 'on the go', 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure7accesstotheinternetonthegopeopleinfo_tcm77-322662.png \"Internet use, 'on the go', 2013\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure7accesstotheinternetonthegopeopleinfo_tcm77-322662.png) \n\nAlmost 9 in 10 (89%) adults aged 16 to 24 used their mobile phone to access the Internet.

The three youngest age groups (16 to 24; 25 to 34 and 35 to 44) all reported similar rates of use, with those aged 25 to 34 leading the way at 43%. Of those aged 65 and over, 1 in 10 adults (11%) used a tablet or portable computer to access the Internet “on the go” in 2013.\n\nOne fifth (21%) of 16 to 24 year olds reported using a device such as a games console or eBook reader to access the Internet away from home or work. This type of access was heavily favoured by the younger age groups, with just 10% of 45 to 54 year olds accessing the Internet over these devices and only 11% of all adults."},{"title":"Public authorities and services","markdown":"In April 2013, the UK Government published details of a system of “[Universal Credit](https://www.gov.uk/government/policies/simplifying-the-welfare-system-and-making-sure-work-pays/supporting-pages/introducing-universal-credit \"Universal Credit\")”; a change to the benefits system in which “most people will apply online and manage their claim through an online account”. This is likely to have a significant impact on the numbers of adults who use the Internet to interact with public authorities and services online.\n\nIn 2013, the most popular reason for accessing a public authority or service website was to obtain information. Approximately, 31% of adults obtained information from public authorities or services such as local authorities, schools and universities, or government departments. For example, as reported earlier, it is likely that a proportion of those adults (43%) that used the Internet to seek health related information used public health websites such as NHS direct."},{"title":"Household internet access","markdown":"In 2013, 21 million households in Great Britain had an Internet connection. This represented 83% of households, up from 80% in 2012 and 57% in 2006.\n\nThere were 4 million households in Great Britain without Internet access in 2013, compared with 10 million in 2006. Figure 9 clearly shows that Internet access by households has increased dramatically since ONS first began collecting these statistics in 1998.\n\nThere were changes in the survey source, periodicity and coverage over the period 1998 to 2005; consequently these estimates (from 1998 to 2005) are not directly comparable with the annual estimates from 2006 onwards, but have been provided as our best indication of growth over this period.\n\n####Figure 9: Households with Internet access, 1998 to 2013\n[![Households with Internet access, 1998 to 2013](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure9householdswithinternetaccess_tcm77-322668.png \"Households with Internet access, 1998 to 2013\")](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/resources/figure9householdswithinternetaccess_tcm77-322668.png) \n#####Source: Office for National Statistics\n#####Notes:\n\n1. UK estimates from 1998 to 2004, Great Britain estimates from 2005 to 2013.\n\nInternet access varies depending on household composition. The majority of households with children have an Internet connection (97%). This is the same figure as households made up of three or more adults (including homes of multiple occupancies such as student accommodation).\n\nAccess to the Internet by single adult households varies considerably depending on age. Where the adult is aged 65 or over, only 40% of households had an Internet connection. In contrast, 74% of households had an Internet connection where the adult was aged 16 to 64 years.\n\nThe way households connect to the Internet has changed considerably in recent years. In 2006, 31% of households made use of a dial-up connection over a standard telephone line. Seven years on and dial-up Internet has almost entirely disappeared from the Great Britain Internet map, with less than 1% of households still connecting this way. Therefore, for the vast majority of households an Internet connection now means a broadband connection over a Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), fibre optic or cable line.\n\nHouseholds accessing broadband, via fibre optic or cable connections, increased by 12 percentage points since 2012 (30%), to 42% in 2013. This is likely, as mentioned earlier, to be a result of increased investment into the availability of fibre optic connections. In comparison, DSL broadband is beginning to lose its dominance. In 2013, only 45% of households reported using a DSL connection, down from 57% in 2012.\n\n<ons-chart path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2013-08-08/a5c667c6\" />\n\n### Reasons for no household Internet access\n\nOf the 4 million households without Internet access, the majority (59%) said that they didn’t have a connection because they 'did not need it'. This is compared with 34% in 2006. While this may suggest that many households without the Internet are actively choosing not to subscribe, there is still a large and important minority who state that barriers prevent them from connecting to the Internet. Approximately, one in five households (20%) indicated that they did not have the Internet in their household due to a lack of computer skills. Further barriers included equipment costs and access costs being high at 13% and 12% of households without Internet access respectively. "}],"accordion":[{"title":"Background notes","markdown":"1. **Key issues specific to this bulletin**\n\n\tThis statistical bulletin provides information about individuals’ use of the Internet and how households access the Internet. The source of this information is the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey. The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey is a multi-purpose survey developed by ONS for use by government departments, other public bodies, charities, academics and the media. It provides a fast, cost effective and reliable way of obtaining information on topics too brief to warrant their own survey.\n\n\tResponses for the Internet Access Survey are normally collected in January, February and March each year. However, due to a data collection problem that affected some of the 2012 estimates, the 2012 survey was re-run over August, September and October 2012. The effect of this is that year on year comparisons of 2012 and 2013 estimates of Internet use (Tables 1 to 12) relate to a comparison period of five months rather than the usual 12 months.\n\n\tA random sample of about 1,800 adults aged 16 and over, living in private households throughout Great Britain are selected each month. After accounting for refusals and where no contact can be made, approximately 1,000 interviews are conducted each month. Further information about the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey is available on the ONS website. For general information on the survey, contact telephone +44 (0)1633 455810, email: <opinions@ons.gov.uk>.\n\n\tThe annual release of estimates of Internet Access commenced in 2006. Internet Access results were originally published from 1998 onwards. Between 1998 and 2006, the results were published more frequently, but were based on smaller sample sizes. There were also various changes made to the survey in this earlier period of collecting Internet Access data, such as the survey vehicle used to collect the data. Some historical Internet Access estimates published before 2006 are available on the ONS website. However, comparing estimates in this release with those from prior to 2006 should be made with caution.\n\n\tThe estimates in the 2013 survey relate to Great Britain. For the period 2006 to 2010, this bulletin was published on a UK basis. Northern Ireland has not been sampled since the 2008 survey, but was included in the survey estimation process for the 2009 and 2010 results, which meant UK estimates were also produced for 2009 and 2010. Northern Ireland was not included in the estimation process for 2011; therefore the coverage of the survey was changed in 2011 from UK to Great Britain. All estimates in this bulletin have been reworked to be on a Great Britain basis. As in previous years, the Isles of Scilly and the Scottish Highlands (North of the Caledonian Canal) and Islands were not sampled but are included in the estimation. \n\n2. **Common pitfalls in interpreting series**\n\n\tThe statistics presented in this release should not be confused with the quarterly estimates of adults who have ever or never used the Internet. These are published in the Internet Access Quarterly Update statistical bulletin. These estimates are derived from the Labour Force Survey which has a much larger sample than the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey.\n\n\tReferences to 2013 in this release refer to data collected in interviews between January and March 2013. \n\n3. **Revisions**\n\n\tThere are no revisions to estimates previously published. \n\n4. **Users and uses of the data**\n\n\t[Eurostat](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/other/eurostat/index.html \"Eurostat\") is the principal user of these statistics. The UK provides statistics to Eurostat measuring households’ and individuals’ use of the Internet and other forms of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in accordance with the ICT [Regulation (EC) No 808/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:143:0049:0049:EN:PDF \"Regulation (EC) No 808/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council\").\n\n\tThe Internet Access estimates are used to provide information that is consistent with other European Union (EU) member states, as part of progress towards measuring EU benchmarking indicators. These EU indicators compare the development and use of ICT across EU member states, and help to provide a better understanding of the adoption of ICT and the Internet by households and individuals at an EU level.\n\n\tICT is considered as critical for improving the competitiveness of European industry and, more generally, to meet the demands of society and the economy. Broadband is considered to be important when measuring access to, and use of, the Internet, as it offers users the possibility to rapidly transfer large volumes of data and keep access lines open. The take-up of broadband is a key ICT policy-making indicator. Widespread access to the Internet via broadband is regarded as essential for the development of advanced services on the Internet, such as e-business, e-government or e-learning. Until 2010 the EU policy framework for ICT was the i2010 initiative called ‘[A European information society for growth and employment](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52005DC0229:EN:NOT \"A European information society for growth and employment\")’ which sought to boost efficiency throughout the EU economy by means of the wider use of ICT.\n\n\tIn May 2010 the European Commission adopted [A digital agenda for Europe][1], a strategy for a digital economy by 2020. The Digital Agenda for Europe is one of the seven flagship initiatives under the [Europe 2020 strategy](http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/index_en.htm \"Europe 2020 strategy\") for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. It outlines policies and actions aimed at maximising the benefits of the digital era to all sections of society and economy.\n\n\tWithin the UK there is wide interest in these statistics from researchers, public bodies, charities, academics and the media.\n\n\tDo you make use of our estimates of annual Internet access and use of computers estimates? If yes, we would like to hear from you (<esociety@ons.gsi.gov.uk>) and understand how you make use of these statistics. This may enable us, in the future, to better meet your needs as a user. \n\n5. **Coherence**\n\n\tThe results published in this bulletin focus on adults’ use of the Internet. These estimates complement the estimates contained in the Internet Access Quarterly Update, which was last published on 15th May 2013. The Internet Access Quarterly Update focuses on adults who have ever or never used the Internet and includes detailed socio-demographic breakdowns. This release was compiled from approximately 3,000 interviews conducted for the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, whereas approximately 41,000 households respond each quarter to the LFS. Therefore the LFS estimates of Internet users are considered to be more reliable.\n\n\tONS’s annual survey of [ICT and e-commerce activity of business](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/rdit2/ict-activity-of-uk-businesses/2011/stb-ecom-2011.html \"STB ECOM 2011\") provides information on business e-commerce and ICT activity of UK businesses. The 2011 survey results were published on 30 November 2012. \n\n6. **Sampling variability**\n\n\tThe Opinions and Lifestyle Survey is carried out by interviewing a nationally representative sample of households in Great Britain. About 1,800 households are sampled each month and estimates are subject to sampling variability, as are those from all sample surveys.\n\n\tThe confidence interval tables below show estimated 95% confidence intervals for selected estimates relating to Internet Access. The estimates come from survey data and so have a degree of statistical error associated with them. Confidence intervals are an indication of the reliability of an estimate; the smaller the interval, the more reliable the estimate is likely to be. With regards to ’95% confidence intervals’, we mean that if we repeated our survey 100 times, 95% of the time (95 times out of 100), the true population value would fall within the range of these confidence intervals.\n\n\t<ons-table path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2013-08-08/99173d17\" />\n\n\t<ons-table path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2013-08-08/b40068ce\" />\n\n\t<ons-table path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/householdcharacteristics/homeinternetandsocialmediausage/bulletins/internetaccesshouseholdsandindividuals/2013-08-08/91fd1345\" />\n\n\tThe larger the sample that is used for a particular estimate, the narrower the confidence interval. Estimates at Great Britain level (for example adults in Great Britain using the Internet) will have a larger sample than estimates of sub-groups of the population (for example adults using the Internet broken down by age group). Therefore the quality of estimates of the whole population will be higher than that for sub-groups.\n\n\tThe voluntary nature of the survey means that people who do not wish to take part in the survey can refuse to do so. The sample is designed to ensure that the results of the survey represent the population. The risk of the survey not being representative is likely to increase with every refusal or non-contact with a sampled household (survey non-response). One measure of the quality of survey results is therefore the response rate.\n\n\tThe response rate for 2013 was 54%, the rate of refusals was 33% and 13% of the sample could not be contacted. The response rate for the 2012 survey was 55%, the rate of refusals was 32% and 12% of the sample could not be contacted. \n\n7. **Calibration**\n\n\tWeights are used in the analysis of the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey data, for both households and for individuals. Each respondent to the survey is assigned a weight which is the number of adults or households that this person represents. These weights are derived by calibration, using population estimates for age group by sex and region. The weights are used to improve the accuracy of results by compensating for different response rates for different groups and by reducing the random variation in estimates.\n\n\tAs the responses are weighted to population estimates, weighted totals of individuals by age group, sex and region from the survey are guaranteed to match the fixed population totals. \n\n8. **Rounding**\n\n\tPercentages in the data tables may not sum to 100 or agree with related totals, due to independently rounded components. \n\n9. **International comparison**\n\n\tA comparable survey is run in all countries of the European Union (EU) and also in some non-EU countries. The measurement of household Internet access and adults’ use of the Internet is under continuing review and development. The Statistical Office of the European Commission (Eurostat) plays a leading role in this, and each year Eurostat leads a process whereby the data requirements for the Internet Access survey in all EU countries are reviewed and updated. Comparative data for EU countries can be found on [Eurostats website](http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Information_society_statistics \"Eurostats website\") \n\n10. **Social media**\n\n\tFollow ONS on [Twitter](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/twitter.html \"Twitter\") and receive up to date information about our statistics.\n\n\tLike ONS on [Facebook](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/index.html \"Facebook\")  to receive our updates in your newsfeed and to post comments on our page.\n\n\tWatch our videos on [YouTube](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/external-links/social-media/youtube.html \"YouTube\").\n\n11. **Special events**\n\n\tONS has published commentary, analysis and policy on 'Special Events' which may affect statistical outputs.
