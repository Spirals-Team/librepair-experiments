It provides estimates from approximately 340,000 individual respondents - the biggest pool of UK social survey data aside from the census.\n\nThe IHS has been developed by ONS to be a cost-effective way of obtaining a large dataset with a number of topics. It also enables analysis at lower level geographies that cannot typically be obtained with other social surveys. The IHS is used by academics, government departments, and other stakeholders to provide evidence for planning, policy and monitoring purposes. It specifically provides data on sexual identity, smoking prevalence and perceived general health to meet users’ needs.\n\nThis large sample size is achieved by asking a core suite of questions on two ONS household surveys: the Annual Population Survey (APS) and the Living Costs and Food Survey (LCF). More detailed information on the survey, and how to carry out your own analyses, can be found in the background notes.\n\nFollowing a statistical products consultation in 2014, the LCF will no longer form part of the IHS from 2014. This means this will be the last release of the IHS based on cases from the APS and LCF. Future releases will be based solely on the APS.\n\nAt present, IHS statistics are designated as experimental. Information on what this means can be found in the background notes."},{"title":"Sexual identity","markdown":"The Integrated Household Survey (IHS) asks a question on self perceived sexual identity of adults in the UK. This question was developed as part of the ONS Sexual Identity Project, which developed, tested and implemented the question to satisfy the increasing demand for data on sexual orientation to meet 2010 Equality Act1. ONS focussed on one component of sexual orientation, sexual identity, as this is the most relevant dimension of sexual orientation to investigate given its relation to experiences of disadvantage and discrimination.\n\nIn 2013, the Integrated Household Survey found 1.6% of adults identified themselves as either gay, lesbian or bisexual2. This comprised of:\n\n- 1.2% of adults identified themselves as gay or lesbian\n\n- 0.5% of adults identified themselves as bisexual\n\nThis compares with 1.5% of adults who identified themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual in 2012, which represents a small increase in 2013. This difference was not, however, statistically significant3.\n\n### Sexual identity by gender\n\nMales were twice as likely as females to consider themselves gay or lesbian:\n\n- 1.6% of adult males identified themselves as gay or lesbian compared to 0.8% of adult females.\n\n- Adult females were more likely to identify themselves as bisexual (0.6%) compared to adult males (0.4%).\n\nTable 1 summarises the distribution between sexual identity and gender in 2013.\n\n<ons-table path=\"/peoplepopulationandcommunity/housing/bulletins/integratedhouseholdsurveyjanuarytodecember2013experimentalstatistics/2014-10-07/55bfb841\" />\n\n### Sexual identity by region\n\nIn 2013, London had the highest proportion of adults who said they were gay, lesbian or bisexual (3.2%). The proportions of adults identifying themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual within other regions ranged from 1.1% in the North East to 1.8% in the North West.

This information is a key measure for monitoring tobacco use in the UK, with various initiatives in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland launched since 2011 aimed at reducing tobacco use.\n\nThe smoking prevalence rate in the UK was 18.7% in 2013. This represents a significant drop from 19.8% in 2012. Figure 3 shows the changes in smoking prevalence in all the constituent countries of the UK. The only statistically significant change came in England with the rate falling from 19.5% in 2012 to 18.4% in 2013.\n\nONS also collects smoking data on the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which has published smoking trends across Great Britain since the turn of the century.

Perceived General Health is a good predictor of demands for health services and is used in the construction of health expectancy metrics such as [Healthy Life Expectancy](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/disability-and-health-measurement/healthy-life-expectancy-at-birth-for-upper-tier-local-authorities--england/2010-12/stb---healthy-life-expectancy.html \"STB - Healthy Life Expectancy\").

Further information on the IHS can be found on the ONS website.\n\n\t1.1. **Consultations**\n\n\tONS has conducted a series of consultations with users about key decisions relating to the IHS. The outcome of each consultation can be found in the attached links:\n\n\t- [Proposal to reduce the number of datasets produced using the IHS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/get-involved/consultations-and-user-surveys/archived-consultations/2012/ihs/index.html \"Integrated Household Survey index\")\n\n\t- [Proposal to rotate the Sexual Identity questions on the IHS](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/get-involved/consultations-and-user-surveys/consultations/integrated-household-survey-questionnaire-content-review---2014/index.html \"Integrated Household Survey Questionnaire Content Review - 2014\")\n\n\t- [Proposal to stop IHS core questions in the Living Costs and Food Survey](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/get-involved/consultations-and-user-surveys/consultations/statistical-products-2013/index.html \"ONS Consultation on Statistical Products 2013\")\n\n2. **Notes on the themes**\n\n\t**2.1 Sexual identity**\n\n\tThe Integrated Household Survey (IHS) asks a question on self perceived sexual identity of adults in the UK. This question was developed as part of the ONS [Sexual Identity Project](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/measuring-equality/equality/sexual-identity-project/index.html \"Sexual Identity Project\"), which developed, tested and implemented the question to satisfy the increasing demand for data on sexual orientation to meet the 2010 Equality Act.\n\n\tWhile the Equality Act 2010, and relevant legislation in the past, referred to sexual orientation, ONS has focused on collecting data on sexual identity. The sexual identity question measures how people see themselves and not how others see them.\n\n\tThe question on sexual identity was developed and tested on a number of surveys in 2008 and was added to the IHS in 2009. The data have been collected to provide accurate statistics to underpin the equality monitoring responsibilities of public sector organisations and to assess the disadvantage or relative discrimination experienced by the lesbian, gay and bisexual population.\n\n\tThe sexual identity question was asked of respondents aged 16 years and over; it was not asked by proxy. Proxy interviews are defined as those where answers are supplied by a third party, who is a member of the respondent’s household.\n\n\tThe sexual identity question was asked in both face-to-face and telephone interviews, at first personal contact. During the face to face interviews, adults were asked; ‘Which of the options on this show card best describes how you think of yourself?’ For telephone interviews, a slightly different way of collecting the information was used: ‘I will now read out a list of terms that people use to describe how they think of themselves’. The list was read out to respondents twice. On the second reading, the respondent had to say ‘stop’ when an appropriate term they identified with was read out. In both modes, the order in which the terms appeared, or were read out, was unique for each household’s respondent to ensure confidentiality.\n\n\tThe ‘Other’ option on the question was included to address the fact that not all people will consider they fall in the first three categories i.e. heterosexual/straight, gay/lesbian or bisexual.\n\n\t**Processing of Sexual Identity Data**\n\n\tA small change was applied to the processing of sexual identity responses from the Annual Population Survey in January to December 2012. A change was applied to the rotation of previous responses to the sexual identity question for 2012. This has led to a small increase in the numbers of non-responses recorded in the Annual Population Survey compared to previous survey estimates.\n\n\t**Non-response and sexual identity**\n\n\tThe voluntary nature of the survey means that people who do not wish to take part in the survey can refuse to do so. Although every effort is made to minimise the impact of non-response to the IHS component surveys, non-response can appear in several stages of the survey:\n\n\t- Household non-response: Where our interviewers are unable to obtain an interview with anyone in the household.\n\n\t- Unit non-response: Where one or member of a household is not available to take part in our interview.\n\n\t- Item non-response: Where an individual who has agreed to take part in our survey does not provide an answer to one or more question (but takes part in the majority of the survey).\n\n\tFor the sexual identity question, there are two main sources of non-response which are reported in our estimates:\n\n\t- Non-responders: These are adults who are part of an eligible household who were not present when the sexual identity question was asked, and therefore are classed as non-responders.\n\n\t- Don’t know/Refusals: These are adults who have taken part in our survey who have declined to provide a valid response to the sexual identity question.\n\n\tIndicative analysis conducted by ONS has suggested the characteristics of responders and non-responders to the sexual identity are similar. Therefore the non-response to this question should not lead to a bias in our estimates (with the distribution of the key characteristics of non-responders broadly following the distribution of our known population). To provide a transparent set of results however, non-responders are included as a category in our results.\n\n\t**2.2 Smoking Prevalence**\n\n\tThe Opinions and Lifestyle Survey report on [Smoking Habits Amongst Adults, 2012](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/ghs/opinions-and-lifestyle-survey/smoking-habits-amongst-adults--2012/rpt-opinions-and-lifestyle-survey---smoking-habits-amongst-adults--2012.html \"RPT Opinions and lifestyle survey, smoking habits amongst adults, 2012\") presents additional smoking prevalence information for 2012. A report for 2013 data is being released in November 2014.\n\n3. **Personal Well-Being**\n\n\tAs part of the Measuring National Well-being programme, ONS in April 2011 added what are termed 'personal well-being' questions to the constituent surveys of the IHS. Personal Well-being concerns a person’s self-reported assessment of their own well-being. Survey questions of this nature aim to capture a person’s well-being by measuring how people think and feel, for example, asking about life satisfaction, meaning and purpose, and day-to-day emotions. Used alongside more objective statistics, they provide a fuller assessment of National Well-being.\n\n\tIn September 2014, ONS produced a [third statistical bulletin](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/personal-well-being-in-the-uk--2013-14/index.html \"Personal Well-Being in the UK, 2013/14\") measuring National Well-being in the UK, the largest constituent survey of the IHS.\n\n4. **Other Sources of Data**\n\n\tInformation on some of the topics covered in this bulletin can also be found from other sources.

The rules and principles which govern pre-release access are featured within the Pre-release Access to Official Statistics Order 2008.\n\n\tA list of the people who have pre-release access to this bulletin is available on the ONS website.\n\n6. **Experimental statistics**\n\n\tExperimental Statistics are those which are in the testing phase, are not yet fully developed and have not been submitted for assessment to the UK Statistics Authority. They are published in order to involve customers and stakeholders in their development, and as a means to build in quality at an early stage. The IHS is designated as Experimental Statistics.\n\n\tFurther information on Experimental Statistics can be found on the ONS website.\n\n7. **Quality**\n\n\tDetailed information relating to quality components of the IHS (including sampling variability, confidence intervals, and detailed methodological information) is in the following documents:\n\n\t- Quality and Methodology Information \n\n\t- IHS User guidance\n\n\tThese documents are on the [IHS web page](http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/social-and-welfare-methodology/integrated-household-survey/index.html \"Integrated Household Survey\").\n\n8. **Confidence Intervals and Statistical Significance**\n\n\t**Confidence Intervals**\n\n\tThe IHS publishes information on confidence intervals to give an indication of the range in which the true population value is likely to fall.\n\n\tFor the IHS, confidence intervals are calculated at the 95% level. This means that 19 times out of 20, IHS estimates would fall within the upper and lower boundaries. For example, a confidence interval of ±0.2% means that an estimate of 93.9% would range between 93.7% and 94.1% (19 times out of 20).\n\n\tInformation on confidence intervals can be found in some figures in this report, and in the associated tables available to download.\n\n\t**Statistical Significance**\n\n\tThroughout this report, the changes reported are deemed statistically significant. This means that we are confident that 19 times out of 20, differences will be down to real changes in our population, rather than a result of sampling variability.\n\n\tIn instances where changes between estimates are not statistically significant, these have been highlighted in the bulletin text, or not commented on in this release.\n\n9.
